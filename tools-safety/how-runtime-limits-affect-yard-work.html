  <h1>How Runtime Limits Affect Yard Work</h1>

  <h2>Work quality depends on uninterrupted completion</h2>
  <p>Yard work assumes a task can be finished in one continuous window. The limiting condition is continuous operating window, and once that window closes mid-task, the finish breaks down.</p>
  <p>The lawn shows this as sharp transitions between completed and unfinished areas.</p>

  <h2>Stopping mid-pass leaves permanent seams</h2>
  <p>When a tool shuts down before a pass is finished, the edge of that pass becomes a hard boundary. The next session never lines up exactly the same.</p>
  <p>The result is visible seams, height changes, or texture shifts that follow the stop point.</p>

  <h2>Restarting resets precision but not alignment</h2>
  <p>After a pause, footing, angle, and pace change slightly. Even careful restarts land differently.</p>
  <p>The lawn records this as doubled lines, offset cuts, or overlapping marks near restart zones.</p>

  <h2>Time pressure increases surface stress</h2>
  <p>As remaining runtime shrinks, movement speeds up. Control drops.</p>
  <p>This shows up as rushed corners, clipped edges, and shallow scalps near the end of a session.</p>

  <h2>Declining performance hides blade problems</h2>
  <p>As tools lose power near the end of their runtime, cutting quality drops without stopping entirely.</p>
  <p>The same visual damage described in <a href="/tools-safety/signs-a-mower-blade-is-dull.html">Signs a Mower Blade Is Dull</a> appears even when the blade itself has not changed.</p>

  <h2>Dirty tools shorten usable runtime</h2>
  <p>Debris buildup increases resistance and heat, shrinking effective operating time. Shutdowns happen earlier and more often.</p>
  <p>The pattern matches <a href="/tools-safety/why-dirty-tools-fail-faster.html">Why Dirty Tools Fail Faster</a>, visible as incomplete sections repeating in the same areas.</p>

  <h2>Interrupted work compounds fatigue</h2>
  <p>Multiple short sessions increase physical strain compared to one continuous pass. Grip, balance, and focus degrade.</p>
  <p>The lawn reflects this as crooked lines and uneven tracking that worsen with each restart.</p>

  <h2>The irreversible boundary is repeated partial completion</h2>
  <p>Once work is consistently broken into unfinished segments, uniform results stop being possible. Every new session layers misalignment onto the last.</p>
  <p>From that point forward, visible inconsistency replaces clean finish.</p>

  <h2>Some jobs exceed safe runtime limits</h2>
  <p>Large or complex areas demand uninterrupted control that short runtimes cannot support.</p>
  <p>This becomes obvious in the uneven outcome described in <a href="/tools-safety/when-hiring-help-is-the-safer-option.html">When Hiring Help Is the Safer Option</a>, where consistency improves only when the entire task can be completed at once.</p>

  <h2>Runtime limits leave visible evidence</h2>
  <p>They show up as seams, overlaps, rushed edges, and uneven texture.</p>
  <p>When those signs repeat, the problem is not effort or technique, but the hard limit imposed by runtime itself.</p>
