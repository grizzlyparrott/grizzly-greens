  <h1>Why Pets Are at Risk During Yard Work</h1>

  <h2>Risk rises when space stops signaling danger</h2>
  <p>Yard work creates moving hazards that rely on clear, visible separation. When that awareness weakens, pets wander into active zones without hesitation.</p>
  <p>You see a dog drift closer because the yard looks unchanged.</p>

  <h2>Noise scrambles instinctive distance</h2>
  <p>Engines flatten sound cues pets use to judge speed and direction. Motion feels slower than it is.</p>
  <p>A pet appears suddenly nearer than you expect.</p>

  <h2>Motion triggers chase and curiosity</h2>
  <p>Spinning lines, blowing debris, and moving wheels invite pursuit. The work becomes the stimulus.</p>
  <p>You watch a pet lock onto the tool instead of moving away.</p>

  <h2>Thrown debris expands the hazard zone</h2>
  <p>Material travels past the operator’s position, breaking invisible lines. Exposure spreads without warning.</p>
  <p>You hear pebbles strike surfaces beyond where you’re standing.</p>

  <h2>Ground-level paths intersect first</h2>
  <p>Low trajectories meet pets before adults register them. Angle decides contact.</p>
  <p>You notice debris skimming at head height for a smaller animal.</p>

  <h2>Assumed skill replaces active separation</h2>
  <p>Confidence in handling tools shifts attention away from space control. Distance gets treated as automatic.</p>
  <p>This mirrors <a href="/tools-safety/why-proper-training-matters-for-homeowners.html">Why Proper Training Matters for Homeowners</a>, where habits stand in for real margins.</p>

  <h2>Experience narrows tolerance without warning</h2>
  <p>Familiar routines make proximity feel normal. Pets move while the operator stays focused forward.</p>
  <p>The pattern aligns with <a href="/tools-safety/how-experience-reduces-tool-damage.html">How Experience Reduces Tool Damage</a>, where repetition hides risk.</p>

  <h2>Abrupt impact causes immediate damage</h2>
  <p>Once a pet meets debris or moving parts, separation no longer exists. Recovery is immediate and uncertain.</p>
  <p>You hear a yelp and everything stops.</p>

  <h2>After contact, control shifts away from the task</h2>
  <p>The yard becomes secondary as response takes over. The earlier loss of boundaries explains the moment fully.</p>
  <p>The space feels smaller and the noise feels louder than before.</p>

  <h2>The risk leaves clear, visible traces</h2>
  <p>Scattered debris, scuffed ground, and a shaken animal mark where control failed. The scene tells the story on its own.</p>
  <p>The need for distance becomes obvious too late, as in <a href="/tools-safety/how-to-reduce-injury-risk-while-working.html">How to Reduce Injury Risk While Working</a>.</p>
