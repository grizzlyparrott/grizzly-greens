  <h1>How Edging Affects Lawn Health</h1>

  <h2>Edging concentrates stress into a fixed line</h2>
  <p>Edging concentrates cutting and contact into the same narrow strip each pass. Once that edge can no longer recover between hits, the grass there stops filling back in.</p>
  <p>The border immediately looks thinner and lower than the rest of the lawn.</p>

  <h2>Clean lines come at the cost of tissue loss</h2>
  <p>Each edging pass removes living material rather than just reshaping growth. Over time, the edge absorbs more removal than it can replace.</p>
  <p>The lawn line begins to retreat, exposing soil along hard surfaces.</p>

  <h2>Repeated edging widens the disturbed zone</h2>
  <p>When the same boundary is edged frequently, damage spreads inward. Grass closest to the line weakens first.</p>
  <p>The healthy turf pulls back unevenly, leaving a scalloped edge instead of a straight one.</p>

  <h2>Soil disruption compounds edge damage</h2>
  <p>Edging tools often cut into the soil itself. That disturbance breaks surface structure and loosens the boundary.</p>
  <p>The edge starts to crumble and collapse rather than hold a sharp line.</p>

  <h2>Timing determines whether edges recover</h2>
  <p>Edges stressed too often never return to full density. The surface never looks finished before it is disturbed again.</p>
  <p>This pattern matches the wear described in <a href="/tools-safety/how-often-lawn-tools-should-be-used.html">How Often Lawn Tools Should Be Used</a>, where repetition prevents visible recovery.</p>

  <h2>Edging exposes hidden risks during yard work</h2>
  <p>Edge work places tools close to feet, hands, and nearby movement. Loss of control happens with little warning.</p>
  <p>The danger mirrors <a href="/tools-safety/why-pets-are-at-risk-during-yard-work.html">Why Pets Are at Risk During Yard Work</a>, where proximity increases consequences.</p>

  <h2>Not all edge disturbance is harmful</h2>
  <p>Some soil disruption can benefit turf when it relieves compaction instead of removing tissue. The difference is whether grass is given space or stripped away.</p>
  <p>This contrast becomes clear in <a href="/tools-safety/when-aeration-tools-make-sense.html">When Aeration Tools Make Sense</a>, where openings recover instead of collapsing.</p>

  <h2>The critical limit appears as edge retreat</h2>
  <p>Once grass no longer reaches the original boundary, the lawn loses ground permanently. Soil stays exposed and the line continues to move inward.</p>
  <p>From that point on, edging enlarges the bare strip instead of sharpening it.</p>

  <h2>Edging effects are written into the lawn</h2>
  <p>Healthy edges appear dense and level with the surrounding turf. Damaged edges look thin, recessed, and unstable.</p>
  <p>The lawn surface makes it clear whether edging supported health or worked against it.</p>
