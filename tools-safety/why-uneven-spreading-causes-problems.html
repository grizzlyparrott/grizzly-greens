  <h1>Why Uneven Spreading Causes Problems</h1>

  <h2>Uneven spreading divides the lawn into zones</h2>
  <p>When material lands inconsistently, the lawn stops behaving as a single surface. The single limiter is distribution consistency, and once it is broken, areas begin responding at different speeds.</p>
  <p>This shows up as visible streaks where grass grows darker or lighter than surrounding turf.</p>

  <h2>Overloaded areas react first and fade later</h2>
  <p>Zones that receive too much material surge quickly, then stall. Growth spikes early and loses stability.</p>
  <p>These areas turn darker at first, then thin or discolor while nearby grass stays steady.</p>

  <h2>Underfed zones lag behind permanently</h2>
  <p>Areas that receive too little never catch up during the same cycle. The window for response closes.</p>
  <p>The lawn develops pale lanes that remain weak even as other sections fill in.</p>

  <h2>Uneven response locks in visual patterns</h2>
  <p>Once growth rates diverge, mowing and weather amplify the difference. Contrast sharpens.</p>
  <p>The surface starts to resemble bands or grids that follow the original spreading path.</p>

  <h2>Cutting height exaggerates distribution errors</h2>
  <p>When grass height varies due to uneven feeding, mowing reveals the difference instantly.</p>
  <p>The effect mirrors <a href="/tools-safety/how-cutting-height-is-set-on-mowers.html">How Cutting Height Is Set on Mowers</a>, where small height changes become obvious across the surface.</p>

  <h2>Equipment issues delay recovery across zones</h2>
  <p>When tools fail or stall during spreading, interruption compounds uneven coverage.</p>
  <p>The same delayed response appears in <a href="/tools-safety/how-tool-failure-delays-lawn-recovery.html">How Tool Failure Delays Lawn Recovery</a>, where timing gaps never fully close.</p>

  <h2>Calibration errors widen the imbalance</h2>
  <p>Spreaders that release material inconsistently exaggerate every pass error.</p>
  <p>This pattern matches <a href="/tools-safety/why-calibration-matters-for-spreaders.html">Why Calibration Matters for Spreaders</a>, where small inaccuracies scale across the lawn.</p>

  <h2>The irreversible boundary is mixed growth stages</h2>
  <p>Once parts of the lawn advance while others fall behind, they stop responding together.</p>
  <p>No later adjustment brings them back into sync during the same season.</p>

  <h2>The lawn exposes uneven spreading clearly</h2>
  <p>Uniform spreading fades into a single surface. Uneven spreading leaves stripes, patches, and stalled zones.</p>
  <p>The grass itself shows where consistency was lost.</p>
