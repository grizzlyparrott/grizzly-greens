  <h1>Why Tool Weight Matters</h1>

  <h2>Weight controls how force settles into the surface</h2>
  <p>Every tool transfers its mass into grass and soil the moment it makes contact. When surface load exceeds what the lawn can tolerate, compressed tracks and flattened blades remain visible long after work ends.</p>
  <p>The surface looks imprinted rather than trimmed.</p>

  <h2>Heavier tools reduce margin for balance errors</h2>
  <p>As tool weight increases, small shifts in grip or footing carry more momentum. Those shifts become visible as sudden dips, tilted cuts, or short gouges that appear without warning.</p>
  <p>The marks follow the path of the imbalance.</p>

  <h2>Weight magnifies contact at edges and turns</h2>
  <p>Turning concentrates force on a smaller area. Heavier tools press harder during those moments.</p>
  <p>This shows up as crushed borders and frayed margins consistent with <a href="/tools-safety/why-trimmers-damage-grass-edges.html">Why Trimmers Damage Grass Edges</a>, where edge damage appears deeper than the surrounding cut.</p>

  <h2>Repeated passes lock weight damage in place</h2>
  <p>Once grass is flattened by excess load, subsequent passes land on an already weakened surface. The same track deepens instead of disappearing.</p>
  <p>The lawn develops permanent-looking lanes where work repeats.</p>

  <h2>Fatigue changes how weight is carried</h2>
  <p>As arms and shoulders tire, heavier tools start to sag or swing unevenly. Control degrades without stopping the task.</p>
  <p>The result is wandering lines and uneven height that worsen toward the end of the session.</p>

  <h2>Heavy tools push users to bypass safeguards</h2>
  <p>Managing extra weight often leads to altered grips or disabled features meant to stabilize motion. Those changes reduce predictability.</p>
  <p>The risk pattern mirrors <a href="/tools-safety/why-disabling-safety-features-is-dangerous.html">Why Disabling Safety Features Is Dangerous</a>, where loss of control shows up before injury does.</p>

  <h2>Prolonged pressure prevents elastic recovery</h2>
  <p>When tool weight leaves impressions that do not rebound between uses, the surface has stopped absorbing load. Grass remains flattened, soil stays firmed, and edges lose definition.</p>
  <p>Beyond this point, lighter touch does not reverse the marks.</p>

  <h2>Weight reveals itself in the finished surface</h2>
  <p>Properly matched tools leave consistent height and clean transitions. Excess weight leaves tracks, crushed edges, and visible drift.</p>
  <p>The lawn makes it clear whether tool weight matched what it could tolerate.</p>
