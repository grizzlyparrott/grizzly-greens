    <h1>How Mowers Actually Cut Grass</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Cutting happens through speed and impact</h2>
      <p>A mower blade does not saw through grass. It strikes each blade at high speed, shearing it cleanly where the cutting edge makes contact.</p>
      <p>The blade typically spins at around 3,000 revolutions per minute. At this speed, the edge travels fast enough to slice rather than bend.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Airflow lifts grass into the blade path</h2>
      <p>The spinning blade creates airflow inside the deck that pulls grass upward and holds it vertical as the blade passes. Without this lift, grass would simply bend away from the blade and spring back uncut.</p>
      <p>Deck design shapes this airflow. A blocked or clogged deck reduces lift and creates uneven cuts.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Blade shape determines clipping movement</h2>
      <p>The angled lift on most mower blades does two things simultaneously. It generates the airflow that stands grass upright, and it moves cut clippings toward the discharge chute.</p>
      <p>Flat blades cut but do not lift or discharge effectively. Mulching blades curve more aggressively to keep clippings circulating under the deck for repeated cutting.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Deck height controls where the cut occurs</h2>
      <p>Adjusting deck height changes the distance between the blade and the ground. This sets how much of each grass blade remains after cutting.</p>
      <p>Cutting too low forces the blade to work harder, increases the chance of scalping uneven ground, and stresses grass during periods of slow growth or temperature extremes like those described in <a href="/watering-irrigation/how-freezing-temperatures-affect-watering.html">How Freezing Temperatures Affect Watering</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Multiple blades increase coverage</h2>
      <p>Mowers with two or three blades cover more width per pass and create overlapping cut zones. This reduces the chance of missing grass between blade paths.</p>
      <p>Each blade still operates on the same principle of speed and impact. More blades simply multiply the effect across a wider deck.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Blade sharpness determines cut quality</h2>
      <p>A sharp blade slices cleanly through grass fibers. A dull blade crushes and tears them, leaving ragged edges that turn brown and invite disease.</p>
      <p>The difference shows up within hours of mowing. Sharp cuts heal quickly. Torn cuts do not.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Forward motion feeds grass into the blade</h2>
      <p>As the mower moves forward, uncut grass enters the deck continuously. The blade encounters and cuts new grass with each rotation.</p>
      <p>Moving too fast overwhelms the blade's ability to lift and cut cleanly. Moving too slow wastes time without improving results.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Weight affects deck stability and control</h2>
      <p>Heavier mowers press down more firmly and maintain better contact with uneven ground. Lighter mowers bounce more easily but require less effort to maneuver.</p>
      <p>The balance between stability and control depends on both the terrain and the operator, which is explored further in <a href="/tools-safety/why-tool-weight-matters.html">Why Tool Weight Matters</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Blade contact creates the primary safety risk</h2>
      <p>The same speed and impact that cuts grass will cut anything else that enters the deck. Hands, feet, and debris all react the same way to blade contact.</p>
      <p>Understanding how cutting actually works clarifies why certain precautions matter, a topic covered in <a href="/tools-safety/how-yard-accidents-can-be-prevented.html">How Yard Accidents Can Be Prevented</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Wet grass disrupts the cutting cycle</h2>
      <p>Moisture makes grass heavier and causes clippings to clump inside the deck. These clumps block airflow, reduce lift, and prevent clean discharge.</p>
      <p>The blade continues spinning at the same speed, but the cutting quality drops because grass cannot stand upright in the blade path.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Cutting is a mechanical process with visible results</h2>
      <p>A mower cuts grass through a combination of blade speed, airflow, and forward motion. Each element depends on the others.</p>
      <p>When any part of the process breaks down, the lawn shows it immediately as uneven height, ragged tips, or uncut patches.</p>
