  <h1>Why Calibration Matters for Spreaders</h1>

  <h2>Calibration controls how much material leaves the machine</h2>
  <p>Spreaders release material through an opening that determines flow rate. The metering constraint is output control, and when it is wrong, every pass applies a different amount than intended.</p>
  <p>The lawn later shows uneven response even though the work looked consistent.</p>

  <h2>Too much material overwhelms localized areas</h2>
  <p>When output is high, material concentrates along walking paths. Those zones surge briefly and then weaken.</p>
  <p>The surface darkens first, then thins or discolors while nearby grass remains stable.</p>

  <h2>Too little material leaves silent gaps</h2>
  <p>Low output creates areas that never receive enough input to respond. Nothing alerts the operator during application.</p>
  <p>Pale or stalled lanes appear weeks later exactly where passes overlapped least.</p>

  <h2>Errors compound across the lawn</h2>
  <p>Calibration mistakes repeat with every step. Small inaccuracies multiply into visible patterns.</p>
  <p>The lawn develops stripes or patchwork growth that follows the spreading route.</p>

  <h2>Poor visibility hides calibration problems</h2>
  <p>When material is hard to see leaving the spreader, errors go unnoticed until damage appears.</p>
  <p>The delay matches <a href="/tools-safety/how-poor-visibility-causes-accidents.html">How Poor Visibility Causes Accidents</a>, where problems surface after control is already lost.</p>

  <h2>Mechanical wear shifts calibration over time</h2>
  <p>Worn gates, cables, or wheels change how much material flows without obvious signs.</p>
  <p>This drift reflects <a href="/tools-safety/mistakes-that-shorten-tool-life.html">Mistakes That Shorten Tool Life</a>, where gradual damage produces sudden failure.</p>

  <h2>Cutting height exaggerates spread errors</h2>
  <p>Uneven growth caused by poor calibration becomes obvious after mowing.</p>
  <p>The contrast resembles <a href="/tools-safety/why-mower-height-is-often-wrong.html">Why Mower Height Is Often Wrong</a>, where small differences become visible across the surface.</p>

  <h2>Asynchronous development creates structural mismatch</h2>
  <p>Once parts of the lawn advance while others lag, they no longer respond together.</p>
  <p>No later correction brings them back into sync during the same cycle.</p>

  <h2>The lawn records calibration errors permanently</h2>
  <p>Correct calibration fades into uniform growth. Incorrect calibration leaves bands, weak zones, and stalled patches.</p>
  <p>The surface itself proves whether output was controlled.</p>
