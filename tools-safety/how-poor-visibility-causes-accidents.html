  <h1>How Poor Visibility Causes Accidents</h1>

  <h2>Accidents start when visual feedback drops first</h2>
  <p>Work becomes unsafe when the eyes stop confirming position and distance. The critical dependency is visual confirmation, and once it weakens, motion continues without reliable reference.</p>
  <p>You feel unsure where the tool edge actually is.</p>

  <h2>Shadows distort depth and speed</h2>
  <p>Uneven light flattens surfaces and hides movement. Objects appear farther away or slower than they are.</p>
  <p>You misjudge how close the tool is to your foot or hand.</p>

  <h2>Obstructions eliminate peripheral awareness</h2>
  <p>Vegetation, debris, and equipment restrict side vision and narrow the effective field of view. Hazards approach from angles that are no longer visually monitored.</p>
  <p>Objects or people become apparent only after crossing into direct forward vision, indicating reduced peripheral coverage.</p>

  <h2>Motion continues when sight hesitates</h2>
  <p>Hands and machines keep moving even as the brain waits for clarity. That delay locks in mistakes.</p>
  <p>You react after the tool has already shifted.</p>

  <h2>Experience cannot replace visibility</h2>
  <p>Familiar routines fail when sight is compromised. Muscle memory assumes conditions that no longer exist.</p>
  <p>This connects to <a href="/tools-safety/why-proper-training-matters-for-homeowners.html">Why Proper Training Matters for Homeowners</a>, where limits still apply.</p>

  <h2>Ground detail disappears under poor light</h2>
  <p>Edges, holes, and uneven surfaces blend together. Foot placement becomes approximate.</p>
  <p>The same loss shows up in <a href="/tools-safety/why-improper-aeration-hurts-soil.html">Why Improper Aeration Hurts Soil</a>, where unseen contact causes damage.</p>

  <h2>Precision tasks fail first</h2>
  <p>Work that depends on tight alignment collapses quickly. Small errors turn into large deviations.</p>
  <p>This mirrors <a href="/tools-safety/how-edging-affects-lawn-health.html">How Edging Affects Lawn Health</a>, where placement decides outcome.</p>

  <h2>The failure point emerges from unseen contact</h2>
  <p>Once something is struck without being seen, recovery is no longer possible mid-motion. The result is already set.</p>
  <p>You hear or feel impact before you register what was hit.</p>

  <h2>After contact, clarity arrives too late</h2>
  <p>The scene becomes obvious only after the mistake. Vision catches up after consequence.</p>
  <p>You suddenly see what was hidden seconds earlier.</p>

  <h2>Poor visibility leaves obvious aftermath</h2>
  <p>Scuffed ground, damaged edges, and startled posture show where sight failed. The marks explain the event.</p>
  <p>The area looks clear only after the accident has already happened.</p>
