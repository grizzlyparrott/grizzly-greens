  <h1>Why Night Yard Work Is Risky</h1>

  <h2>Risk begins when visual confirmation disappears</h2>
  <p>Night removes the ability to verify position and distance in real time. As visual feedback drops, movement continues without reliable correction.</p>
  <p>You feel unsure where tool edges and obstacles actually are.</p>

  <h2>Artificial light flattens depth perception</h2>
  <p>Headlights and porch lights create glare and hard shadows. Surfaces look closer or farther than they are.</p>
  <p>You misjudge how near the ground or object is.</p>

  <h2>Peripheral awareness collapses in darkness</h2>
  <p>Vision narrows to the brightest area. Movement outside that cone goes unnoticed.</p>
  <p>You get startled by something entering view suddenly.</p>

  <h2>Familiar yards stop behaving predictably</h2>
  <p>Routine layouts rely on memory instead of sight. Small changes become hazards.</p>
  <p>You step where you thought clear ground existed.</p>

  <h2>Precision tasks lose reference points</h2>
  <p>Alignment-based work becomes guesswork. Small errors multiply fast.</p>
  <p>This mirrors <a href="/tools-safety/why-calibration-matters-for-spreaders.html">Why Calibration Matters for Spreaders</a>, where visibility defines accuracy.</p>

  <h2>Noise replaces sight as a warning system</h2>
  <p>At night, sound becomes the primary cue. Reaction arrives after motion is already committed.</p>
  <p>You hear a change before you see the problem.</p>

  <h2>Planning feels unnecessary once work has started</h2>
  <p>Darkness compresses decision time and encourages pushing through. Stops feel more disruptive.</p>
  <p>The pattern aligns with <a href="/tools-safety/why-safety-planning-is-ignored.html">Why Safety Planning Is Ignored</a>, where momentum overrides caution.</p>

  <h2>Hidden collision triggers sudden damage</h2>
  <p>Once a tool or foot strikes something not seen, recovery is no longer possible mid-motion. The outcome is fixed.</p>
  <p>You feel or hear impact before understanding what was hit.</p>

  <h2>After contact, clarity arrives too late</h2>
  <p>The scene becomes obvious only once the mistake has occurred. Vision catches up after consequence.</p>
  <p>You suddenly see the obstacle clearly.</p>

  <h2>Night accidents leave unmistakable traces</h2>
  <p>Scuffed ground, damaged edges, and shaken posture show where darkness removed control. The evidence explains itself.</p>
  <p>The yard looks clear only after the risk has already played out.</p>
