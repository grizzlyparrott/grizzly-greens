  <h1>How to Reduce Injury Risk While Working</h1>

  <h2>Injury risk rises when control limits are crossed</h2>
  <p>Most injuries happen after work quietly exceeds what the body can manage. Once effort pushes past what can be controlled, correction arrives too late.</p>
  <p>You feel movements becoming forced instead of guided.</p>

  <h2>Awareness fails before strength does</h2>
  <p>The body keeps moving even as attention fades. That gap allows small errors to stack.</p>
  <p>You realize mistakes only after they’ve already happened.</p>

  <h2>Tool behavior shapes exposure</h2>
  <p>Different machines demand different levels of feedback and timing. Some allow smoother correction than others.</p>
  <p>This contrast appears in <a href="/tools-safety/electric-vs-gas-lawn-equipment.html">Electric vs Gas Lawn Equipment</a>, where response speed changes outcomes.</p>

  <h2>Rising wear quietly raises required effort</h2>
  <p>Tool degradation forces additional force to achieve the same output. The added demand transfers directly into the body rather than showing as obvious equipment failure.</p>
  <p>Tasks require more exertion despite unchanged conditions, materials, or workflow.</p>

  
  <h2>Fatigue narrows the margin for error</h2>
  <p>As recovery falls behind, timing slips. Movements stay confident while precision drops.</p>
  <p>You feel slower to react to small changes.</p>

  <h2>Task structure matters more than task type</h2>
  <p>Repeated starts, stops, and lifts tax the body differently than steady motion. Structure decides strain.</p>
  <p>The effect mirrors <a href="/tools-safety/when-repairs-make-more-sense-than-replacement.html">When Repairs Make More Sense Than Replacement</a>, where workload shifts change impact.</p>

  <h2>Momentum hides loss of control</h2>
  <p>Once movement is underway, it carries past safe limits. Recognition lags motion.</p>
  <p>You feel pulled into finishing instead of adjusting.</p>

  <h2>The point of failure arises from delayed correction</h2>
  <p>When reaction comes after force commits, recovery is no longer possible. The event is already set.</p>
  <p>You recognize the problem only after contact or strain.</p>

  <h2>After the boundary, risk compounds quickly</h2>
  <p>The body protects damage by changing movement. That change raises exposure elsewhere.</p>
  <p>You feel new tension appear in different areas.</p>

  <h2>Reduced risk leaves clear physical signals</h2>
  <p>Smooth motion, steady grip, and consistent pace show control is intact. The body feels quiet instead of taxed.</p>
  <p>You finish work without replaying close calls.</p>
