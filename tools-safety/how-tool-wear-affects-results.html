  <h1>How Tool Wear Affects Results</h1>

  <h2>Results slip before failure becomes obvious</h2>
  <p>Most tools lose accuracy long before they stop working. The governing accuracy ceiling is precision retention, and once it fades, effort fills the gap.</p>
  <p>You see acceptable motion but disappointing outcomes.</p>

  <h2>Worn edges replace clean action with drag</h2>
  <p>As surfaces round and dull, contact shifts from cutting to tearing. The work still happens, but quality drops.</p>
  <p>You notice frayed edges and uneven finishes.</p>

  <h2>Alignment drift changes where force lands</h2>
  <p>Small wear in joints and mounts redirects pressure. Results vary pass to pass without obvious cause.</p>
  <p>You see stripes or patches that did not appear before.</p>

  <h2>Vibration masks accuracy loss</h2>
  <p>Wear increases vibration, which feels like power. Control quietly decreases while the tool seems busy.</p>
  <p>Your hands feel buzzed while the surface looks rough.</p>

  <h2>Compensation multiplies stress</h2>
  <p>Users push harder to make worn tools perform. Extra passes amplify damage instead of fixing it.</p>
  <p>This pattern aligns with <a href="/tools-safety/why-equipment-problems-compound-lawn-issues.html">Why Equipment Problems Compound Lawn Issues</a>, where correction becomes harm.</p>

  <h2>Safety margins shrink as effort rises</h2>
  <p>Forcing worn tools demands tighter timing and grip. Control gets harder to maintain.</p>
  <p>This mirrors <a href="/tools-safety/how-to-reduce-injury-risk-while-working.html">How to Reduce Injury Risk While Working</a>, where limits matter most under strain.</p>

  <h2>Body strain increases before results improve</h2>
  <p>More force transfers into the body when tools stop doing their share. Output stays flat while fatigue climbs.</p>
  <p>The effect echoes <a href="/tools-safety/why-yard-work-causes-long-term-pain.html">Why Yard Work Causes Long-Term Pain</a>, where repetition carries the cost.</p>

  <h2>The irreversible boundary is material deformation</h2>
  <p>Once components bend, chip, or lose true shape, precision cannot be restored mid-use. Performance is locked lower.</p>
  <p>You hear scraping or feel binding that never used to exist.</p>

  <h2>After the boundary, defects propagate quickly</h2>
  <p>Deformed parts accelerate wear elsewhere. Decline speeds up with every pass.</p>
  <p>You see multiple issues appear together.</p>

  <h2>Wear leaves visible fingerprints</h2>
  <p>Uneven finishes, repeated rework, and tired posture show where precision slipped away. The results tell the story.</p>
  <p>The area looks worked but not finished.</p>
