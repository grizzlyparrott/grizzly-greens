  <h1>Push vs Self-Propelled Mowers Explained</h1>

  <h2>The real difference is how movement is controlled</h2>
  <p>Both mower types cut grass the same way, but they move differently across the lawn. The tracking constraint is controllable forward motion, and when that is exceeded, the mower stops tracking evenly.</p>
  <p>The lawn shows this as wavy cut lines and inconsistent striping after a single pass.</p>

  <h2>Push mowers reveal effort through pace changes</h2>
  <p>A push mower moves only as fast as the operator drives it. Any slowdown or surge transfers directly to the cut.</p>
  <p>The result is visible as short patches where the mower lingered and taller streaks where it moved faster.</p>

  <h2>Self-propelled mowers mask uneven ground</h2>
  <p>A powered drive system keeps the mower moving even when resistance changes. On uneven ground, that force pulls the deck forward instead of letting it float.</p>
  <p>This leaves shallow scalps on high spots and pressed tracks where wheels kept traction.</p>

  <h2>Fatigue shows up differently with each design</h2>
  <p>Push mowers concentrate strain in the upper body, while self-propelled models shift it to balance and grip. As fatigue builds, control slips.</p>
  <p>The lawn records this as crooked passes and sudden deviations late in the session.</p>

  <h2>Cold conditions exaggerate loss of control</h2>
  <p>Cold stiffens hands and slows reaction time. A self-propelled mower continues pulling forward while grip weakens.</p>
  <p>The increased risk described in <a href="/tools-safety/how-cold-affects-tool-safety.html">How Cold Affects Tool Safety</a> becomes visible as wheel spin marks and drifted edges.</p>

  <h2>Improper choice wastes motion instead of saving it</h2>
  <p>Using a self-propelled mower in tight spaces or a push mower on large slopes forces constant correction. Time is lost to repositioning rather than cutting.</p>
  <p>The inefficiency matches what’s outlined in <a href="/tools-safety/why-improper-tool-choice-wastes-time.html">Why Improper Tool Choice Wastes Time</a> and shows up as uneven coverage.</p>

  <h2>Speed increases the cost of small mistakes</h2>
  <p>Self-propelled units repeat the same movement pattern quickly. A small steering error becomes a long visible flaw before it can be corrected.</p>
  <p>The lawn ends up with repeated arcs or diagonal scars across multiple rows.</p>

  <h2>The irreversible boundary is when forward motion outpaces correction</h2>
  <p>Once the mower moves faster than the operator can guide, accuracy collapses. Slowing hand movement no longer improves tracking.</p>
  <p>From that point on, each pass leaves new visible errors beside the last.</p>

  <h2>Safety signals appear before injuries do</h2>
  <p>Loss of control shows up first as jerky movement and uneven tracking. Those same conditions increase the chance of slips or missteps.</p>
  <p>The warning signs align with <a href="/tools-safety/how-to-reduce-injury-risk-while-working.html">How to Reduce Injury Risk While Working</a>, where instability precedes accidents.</p>

  <h2>The lawn reveals whether the mower matched the job</h2>
  <p>When control matches the mower type, lines are straight and height is consistent. When it does not, the surface shows wandering cuts, pressed tracks, and repeated corrections.</p>
  <p>The difference between push and self-propelled mowers is already visible by the time the engine is shut off.</p>
