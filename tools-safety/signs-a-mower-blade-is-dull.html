    <h1>Signs a Mower Blade Is Dull</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Grass tips turn brown within a day</h2>
      <p>The most visible sign of a dull blade is browning that appears across the entire lawn within 24 to 48 hours of mowing. The grass looks tan or grayish instead of uniformly green.</p>
      <p>This happens because torn grass fibers dry out faster than cleanly cut ones. The damaged tissue dies back and changes color.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Grass blades look frayed instead of clean</h2>
      <p>Inspect individual grass blades after mowing. A sharp blade leaves smooth, even tips. A dull blade leaves ragged, shredded ends that look torn rather than cut.</p>
      <p>The fraying is consistent across the lawn. If most grass tips show damage, the blade is dull.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The mower bogs down more often</h2>
      <p>A dull blade forces the engine to work harder to maintain blade speed. The mower slows down in thick grass and may stall when encountering clumps or damp areas.</p>
      <p>This increased load is noticeable during operation. The engine sound changes and forward progress becomes more difficult.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Uncut grass appears between wheel tracks</h2>
      <p>When a blade loses its edge, it stops cutting cleanly in areas where grass leans away from the blade path. Missed patches show up as taller grass between mowing passes.</p>
      <p>These uncut areas require a second pass to correct, which doubles the time and effort needed to finish the lawn.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Clippings look larger and less uniform</h2>
      <p>A sharp blade cuts grass into relatively uniform pieces. A dull blade tears grass into irregular chunks that vary widely in size.</p>
      <p>These larger clippings take longer to decompose and are more likely to form visible clumps on the lawn surface.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The mower vibrates more than usual</h2>
      <p>A blade that has hit rocks or hard objects develops nicks and bends. These irregularities create imbalance that shows up as increased vibration during operation.</p>
      <p>Excessive vibration not only indicates blade damage but also contributes to the conditions described in <a href="/tools-safety/why-mowers-cause-most-yard-injuries.html">Why Mowers Cause Most Yard Injuries</a>, where loss of control increases risk.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Fuel consumption increases noticeably</h2>
      <p>A dull blade requires more engine power to maintain cutting speed. This increased load burns more fuel per mowing session.</p>
      <p>The difference becomes obvious over several mowings. A tank that used to last for the entire property now runs out partway through.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The blade edge feels rounded instead of sharp</h2>
      <p>With the mower off and the spark plug disconnected, carefully run your finger along the blade edge. A sharp blade feels distinctly edged. A dull blade feels smooth and rounded.</p>
      <p>Visible nicks, dents, or flat spots also indicate the blade needs attention. These damaged areas prevent clean cutting even if the rest of the edge is still sharp.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Grass stays flattened after mowing</h2>
      <p>A dull blade tears grass downward rather than slicing it cleanly. This leaves grass blades lying flat instead of standing upright after the mower passes.</p>
      <p>The flattened areas create visible tracks that follow the mowing pattern and take hours to recover.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Operating the mower becomes more physically demanding</h2>
      <p>When the blade loses its edge, more effort is required to push the mower through grass. The increased resistance creates fatigue faster than normal.</p>
      <p>This physical strain is one of several factors explored in <a href="/tools-safety/when-yard-work-should-be-stopped.html">When Yard Work Should Be Stopped</a>, where accumulated fatigue affects both performance and safety.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Blade condition affects injury patterns</h2>
      <p>A dull or damaged blade increases the likelihood of throwing debris unpredictably. The torn grass and irregular blade surface create more airborne material that escapes the deck.</p>
      <p>This connection between blade condition and projectile behavior is detailed in <a href="/tools-safety/how-lawn-injuries-actually-happen.html">How Lawn Injuries Actually Happen</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Multiple signs appear together</h2>
      <p>A dull blade rarely shows just one symptom. Brown tips, increased engine strain, uneven cuts, and excessive vibration typically appear in combination.</p>
      <p>When several of these signs are present simultaneously, the blade has moved well past the point where sharpening should have occurred.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The lawn communicates blade condition clearly</h2>
      <p>Grass responds immediately to blade sharpness. A sharp blade produces clean, green results. A dull blade produces brown, ragged damage.</p>
      <p>The signs are consistent and repeatable. When they appear, sharpening the blade eliminates them completely within the next mowing.</p>
