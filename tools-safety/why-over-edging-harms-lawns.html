  <h1>Why Over-Edging Harms Lawns</h1>

  <h2>Edging compresses damage into a single line</h2>
  <p>Edging applies force to the same boundary every time work is done. Once that boundary is stressed beyond its ability to regenerate, grass along the line stops returning.</p>
  <p>The edge immediately appears thinner and recessed compared to the rest of the lawn.</p>

  <h2>Each pass removes living surface</h2>
  <p>Over-edging strips more tissue than the boundary can replace between sessions. The loss accumulates instead of resetting.</p>
  <p>The lawn line visibly pulls back, leaving soil exposed where grass once reached.</p>

  <h2>Sharp lines come from material loss, not control</h2>
  <p>A crisp edge is created by cutting deeper, not by improving alignment. Repeating that depth compounds the loss.</p>
  <p>The border looks clean at first, then progressively lower and weaker.</p>

  <h2>Soil disruption destabilizes the boundary</h2>
  <p>Edging tools often cut into soil as well as grass. That disturbance breaks support under the edge.</p>
  <p>The boundary begins to crumble, slough, or collapse inward after rainfall or foot traffic.</p>

  <h2>Frequency accelerates edge retreat</h2>
  <p>When edging happens before the boundary recovers, the weakened zone never closes. Each session starts from a lower baseline.</p>
  <p>The edge shifts inward in small but visible steps.</p>

  <h2>Tool quality does not change the outcome</h2>
  <p>Heavier, sharper, or more expensive equipment still removes material when used repeatedly in the same place.</p>
  <p>The pattern mirrors <a href="/tools-safety/why-expensive-tools-arent-always-better.html">Why Expensive Tools Aren’t Always Better</a>, where results degrade despite higher-end gear.</p>

  <h2>Over-edging increases handling risk</h2>
  <p>Working repeatedly at borders places tools close to feet and hard surfaces. Control errors become more likely as precision drops.</p>
  <p>The danger aligns with <a href="/tools-safety/mistakes-that-increase-injury-risk.html">Mistakes That Increase Injury Risk</a>, where repetition magnifies exposure.</p>

  <h2>Margin disappearance signals failure</h2>
  <p>Once grass can no longer reach the original boundary, the lawn has lost ground permanently. Soil remains exposed and unstable.</p>
  <p>From that point on, edging widens the bare strip instead of defining it.</p>

  <h2>Over-edging leaves a visible signature</h2>
  <p>Healthy lawns meet borders cleanly and evenly. Over-edged lawns show sunken lines, exposed soil, and uneven margins.</p>
  <p>The boundary itself proves whether edging supported the lawn or stripped it away.</p>
