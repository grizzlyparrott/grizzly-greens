  <h1>Difference Between Trimming and Edging</h1>

  <h2>Trimming spreads contact, edging concentrates it</h2>
  <p>Trimming removes excess growth across broader areas, while edging focuses contact into a fixed line. The single limiter is boundary tolerance, and once that limit is exceeded, recovery stops.</p>
  <p>The lawn shows this as healthy interior grass with thinning or recessed borders.</p>

  <h2>Trimming leaves diffuse wear patterns</h2>
  <p>Because trimming contact moves constantly, damage is spread out. Individual blades recover between passes.</p>
  <p>The surface may look slightly uneven at first but does not retreat in a straight line.</p>

  <h2>Edging removes living material at the boundary</h2>
  <p>Edging does not just shape growth, it cuts into it. Each pass removes tissue from the same spot.</p>
  <p>The lawn line visibly pulls back, exposing soil where grass once reached.</p>

  <h2>Recovery differs at edges versus open turf</h2>
  <p>Interior grass regrows from all sides, but edges only recover from one direction. That asymmetry limits regrowth.</p>
  <p>The result is a step-down where turf meets hard surfaces.</p>

  <h2>Soil disturbance amplifies edging damage</h2>
  <p>Edging tools often disturb soil as well as grass. That disruption weakens the boundary further.</p>
  <p>The edge begins to crumble and lose its shape instead of staying sharp.</p>

  <h2>Some disturbance opens soil without stripping grass</h2>
  <p>Tools that relieve pressure without removing tissue allow grass to rebound. The difference is visible in how openings close instead of widening.</p>
  <p>This contrast mirrors <a href="/tools-safety/how-lawn-aerators-actually-work.html">How Lawn Aerators Actually Work</a>, where disturbance improves structure rather than eroding edges.</p>

  <h2>Rushing blurs the line between trimming and edging</h2>
  <p>When pace increases, trimming tools drift into edge zones and edging tools bite deeper than intended.</p>
  <p>The risk described in <a href="/tools-safety/why-rushing-causes-tool-injuries.html">Why Rushing Causes Tool Injuries</a> shows up as uneven borders and sudden overcuts.</p>

  <h2>Edge work increases exposure to nearby movement</h2>
  <p>Edging places tools close to walkways, pets, and people. Loss of control happens abruptly.</p>
  <p>The hazard matches <a href="/tools-safety/why-pets-are-at-risk-during-yard-work.html">Why Pets Are at Risk During Yard Work</a>, where proximity magnifies consequences.</p>

  <h2>The irreversible boundary is edge retreat</h2>
  <p>Once grass no longer reaches the original boundary, the lawn has lost ground permanently. Soil stays exposed.</p>
  <p>From that point on, edging widens the bare strip instead of refining it.</p>

  <h2>The lawn makes the difference obvious</h2>
  <p>Trimming leaves grass dense and level. Edging leaves borders thin, recessed, or unstable.</p>
  <p>The finished surface shows whether contact was spread or concentrated.</p>
