    <h1>Why Dull Blades Damage Lawns</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Dull blades fail at the single requirement: clean contact</h2>
      <p>A mower blade only works when it slices cleanly through grass. Once the edge dulls, the blade stops cutting and begins tearing. The lawn records this immediately as frayed tips, uneven texture, and a finish that looks stressed instead of fresh.</p>
      <p>The damage is mechanical, not cosmetic.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Torn fibers dry out faster than clean cuts</h2>
      <p>Sharp blades shear grass, leaving smooth edges that retain moisture. Dull blades crush and rip the tissue, exposing more surface area to air. These torn fibers dry out within a day or two, turning white or brown across the entire lawn.</p>
      <p>The discoloration is the lawn’s response to shredded tissue, not heat or drought.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Dull blades increase surface stress with every pass</h2>
      <p>Each torn cut forces the plant to repair more damage than normal. When this happens repeatedly, the lawn shifts energy from growth to recovery. The result is thinning, slower rebound, and a surface that looks tired even when watered correctly.</p>
      <p>Stress compounds because the blade keeps repeating the same injury pattern.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Uneven edges reveal where the blade has lost its shape</h2>
      <p>Blades rarely dull evenly. One section of the edge often degrades faster, creating streaks or height variations that match the blade’s rotation path. These repeating arcs are the lawn’s way of showing which part of the blade is failing.</p>
      <p>The pattern is consistent because the flaw is consistent.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Dull blades make aeration tools work harder</h2>
      <p>Grass weakened by torn cuts responds poorly to additional stress. When aeration tools are used on already damaged turf, the openings widen, the soil surface tears, and recovery slows.</p>
      <p>This interaction is explored in <a href="/tools-safety/difference-between-spike-and-core-aerators.html">Difference Between Spike and Core Aerators</a>, where the type of aeration tool determines how much additional stress the lawn can tolerate.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Weak grass increases the risk of slips and missteps</h2>
      <p>Thin, damaged turf loses traction. When the surface becomes uneven or slick from torn tissue, footing becomes less predictable. This affects both mower control and personal stability.</p>
      <p>The connection is detailed in <a href="/tools-safety/why-footwear-matters-for-yard-work.html">Why Footwear Matters for Yard Work</a>, where surface condition directly influences safety.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Dull blades change how the lawn responds to aeration</h2>
      <p>A lawn cut cleanly recovers quickly from aeration. A lawn cut with a dull blade struggles. Torn fibers and stressed crowns make the turf less resilient, and aeration tools amplify the existing weakness.</p>
      <p>This timing relationship is explained in <a href="/tools-safety/when-aeration-tools-make-sense.html">When Aeration Tools Make Sense</a>, where surface condition determines whether aeration helps or harms.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Dull blades force trimmers to compensate</h2>
      <p>When mowing leaves ragged edges, trimmers are often used to “clean up” the finish. But trimmers rely on clean mower cuts to maintain uniform height. When the mower tears the grass, the trimmer exaggerates the unevenness.</p>
      <p>The mechanics behind this are outlined in <a href="/tools-safety/string-trimmer-basics-explained.html">String Trimmer Basics Explained</a>, where cutting behavior depends on the condition of the surrounding turf.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The lawn reveals dull blades long before the tool does</h2>
      <p>Grass does not hide blade problems. It shows them as frayed tips, dull color, uneven height, and a finish that worsens with each pass. These signs appear before the blade looks worn and long before the mower feels different.</p>
      <p>When these signals appear together, the blade is not just dull—it is actively damaging the lawn.</p>
