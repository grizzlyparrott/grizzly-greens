    <h1>Common Lawn Tool Mistakes</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Mistakes compound faster than corrections</h2>
      <p>Most lawn tool mistakes are not dramatic failures but small errors repeated consistently. Each repetition adds stress that the lawn absorbs and displays as progressive damage.</p>
      <p>The lawn degrades steadily rather than suddenly.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Running blades until performance visibly drops</h2>
      <p>Waiting for obvious signs of blade dullness means the blade has been tearing grass for weeks. By the time brown tips and ragged cuts become unavoidable, the damage is already widespread.</p>
      <p>Understanding <a href="/tools-safety/signs-a-mower-blade-is-dull.html">Signs a Mower Blade Is Dull</a> prevents this lag between blade failure and operator response.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Storing tools without preparation</h2>
      <p>Tools left uncleaned and unchecked after the final mowing of the season start the next year already compromised. Blades rust, seals dry out, and parts seize while sitting idle.</p>
      <p>The first spring mowing reveals what winter did to unprotected equipment, which is why <a href="/tools-safety/why-off-season-care-matters.html">Why Off-Season Care Matters</a> extends beyond simple storage.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Using tools that are too heavy or too light</h2>
      <p>A mower that is too heavy for the operator to control smoothly creates uneven passes and missed spots. A trimmer that is too light vibrates excessively and requires constant pressure to maintain contact.</p>
      <p>Tool weight affects both the quality of work and the fatigue that builds over a full mowing session, a relationship explored in <a href="/tools-safety/why-tool-weight-matters.html">Why Tool Weight Matters</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Mowing wet grass repeatedly</h2>
      <p>Wet grass clumps under the deck, clogs the discharge chute, and creates uneven cuts that leave visible tracks. The clippings mat down on the surface and block sunlight from reaching the grass beneath.</p>
      <p>One wet mowing is sometimes unavoidable. Doing it repeatedly turns it into a pattern that stresses the lawn.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Ignoring height adjustment throughout the season</h2>
      <p>Grass grows at different rates depending on temperature and rainfall. Keeping the same cutting height from April through October means cutting too short during slow growth periods and scalping during rapid growth.</p>
      <p>Adjusting height by half an inch in either direction prevents most seasonal stress.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Mowing the same pattern every time</h2>
      <p>Repeated passes in the same direction compact soil along wheel tracks and create ruts that hold water. Grass in these tracks grows slower and thinner than surrounding areas.</p>
      <p>Alternating mowing direction each week distributes compaction and prevents permanent tracking.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Using dull edgers and trimmers on borders</h2>
      <p>Dull edging tools tear grass and roots rather than cutting them cleanly. The edges fray and die back, creating a wider and wider border of damaged turf that expands with each use.</p>
      <p>Sharp edges heal quickly. Torn edges do not.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Forcing tools through thick growth</h2>
      <p>Pushing a mower harder when it bogs down in tall grass does not improve the cut. It overloads the engine, bends the blade, and tears grass instead of cutting it.</p>
      <p>Raising the deck and making a second pass at the desired height produces better results with less strain on both tool and operator.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Neglecting small damage until it spreads</h2>
      <p>A cracked trimmer head or loose bolt seems insignificant until the vibration it causes creates uneven cuts across the entire property. Small mechanical failures amplify into large functional problems.</p>
      <p>Addressing damage when it first appears prevents it from becoming a recurring issue.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Mistakes reveal themselves through repetition</h2>
      <p>A single instance of poor technique or neglected maintenance rarely destroys a lawn. The same mistake made every week for an entire season does.</p>
      <p>The lawn shows what happens when small errors are allowed to accumulate without correction.</p>
