  <h1>When Yard Work Should Be Stopped</h1>

  <h2>Work should stop when control starts slipping</h2>
  <p>Yard work only stays safe while movement remains deliberate. The attentional threshold is controllable awareness, and once it fades, mistakes compound faster than they can be corrected.</p>
  <p>You feel movements becoming rushed instead of steady.</p>

  <h2>Environmental signals shift before danger looks obvious</h2>
  <p>Light, moisture, and surface conditions change how tools behave. These shifts appear subtly before they cause trouble.</p>
  <p>You notice footing or grip no longer feels predictable.</p>

  <h2>Tool feedback grows inconsistent</h2>
  <p>Vibration, sound, or resistance changes when equipment stops behaving normally. That inconsistency demands attention the body may not have.</p>
  <p>You hear irregular pitch or feel uneven pull through the handle.</p>

  <h2>Physical fatigue masks warning signs</h2>
  <p>Tired muscles keep working while awareness falls behind. Pain arrives after damage, not before.</p>
  <p>You realize stiffness only when you pause.</p>

  <h2>External damage continues even when effort increases</h2>
  <p>Pushing through worsening conditions often harms the lawn without improving results. Stress transfers outward.</p>
  <p>This overlap appears in <a href="/weeds-pests/how-lawn-insects-damage-grass.html">How Lawn Insects Damage Grass</a>, where harm progresses unnoticed.</p>

  <h2>Equipment decay removes remaining margin</h2>
  <p>Rust, wear, and moisture change how force transfers through tools. Small failures raise risk suddenly.</p>
  <p>The effect matches <a href="/tools-safety/why-rust-ruins-equipment.html">Why Rust Ruins Equipment</a>, where decline hides inside normal use.</p>

  <h2>Momentum replaces deliberate movement</h2>
  <p>Once the body commits to finishing instead of adjusting, correction becomes delayed. Motion leads thought.</p>
  <p>You feel pulled into continuing even as conditions worsen.</p>

  <h2>The irreversible boundary is loss of responsive control</h2>
  <p>When reaction arrives after force commits, recovery is no longer possible. The event is already underway.</p>
  <p>You recognize the problem only after a slip, strain, or impact.</p>

  <h2>After the boundary, damage becomes unavoidable</h2>
  <p>Continuing work amplifies harm to the body, tools, and lawn. The system cannot stabilize mid-failure.</p>
  <p>You see new marks, soreness, or tool issues appear rapidly.</p>

  <h2>Stopping leaves clear contrast</h2>
  <p>Once work ends, the difference becomes obvious. Quiet tools, stable footing, and fading tension show how close failure was.</p>
  <p>The pause explains everything the yard could not.</p>
