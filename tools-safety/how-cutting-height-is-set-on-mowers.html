    <h1>How Cutting Height Is Set on Mowers</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Cutting height is controlled by deck position and blade clearance</h2>
      <p>Every mower sets cutting height by changing the distance between the blade and the ground. This is done through deck adjustments, wheel settings, or lift mechanisms depending on the mower type.</p>
      <p>The lawn reveals when the height is wrong through scalping, uneven color, or patches that recover slower than the rest of the yard.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Wheel settings determine the mower’s baseline height</h2>
      <p>On most walk‑behind mowers, each wheel has preset notches that raise or lower the deck. Higher wheel positions lift the blade farther from the soil; lower positions bring it closer.</p>
      <p>Uneven wheel settings create an unintentional tilt, which produces streaks and inconsistent cutting patterns.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Deck lift systems control height on riding and zero‑turn mowers</h2>
      <p>Larger mowers use lever‑based or foot‑pedal lift systems to raise or lower the entire deck at once. These systems rely on linkages that must stay aligned to maintain a consistent cutting height.</p>
      <p>When linkages wear or bend, the deck drifts out of level, creating scalped areas and uneven stripes.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Blade length and shape influence effective cutting height</h2>
      <p>Even with the deck set correctly, worn or shortened blades reduce the mower’s true cutting height. A blade that has been sharpened too many times or damaged by debris sits higher inside the deck, cutting lower than intended.</p>
      <p>This mismatch is one of the equipment issues described in <a href="/tools-safety/why-equipment-problems-compound-lawn-issues.html">Why Equipment Problems Compound Lawn Issues</a>, where small mechanical changes create visible surface stress.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Improper height settings amplify common tool mistakes</h2>
      <p>Cutting too low exposes the crown and removes too much leaf surface. Cutting too high allows the grass to fold instead of being cut cleanly. Both conditions make the lawn more sensitive to tool problems.</p>
      <p>This interaction is part of the broader patterns outlined in <a href="/tools-safety/common-lawn-tool-mistakes.html">Common Lawn Tool Mistakes</a>, where incorrect settings multiply the effects of dull blades, uneven wheels, and rushed passes.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The lawn confirms when the height is wrong</h2>
      <p>Grass reacts immediately to incorrect cutting height. Scalping shows the deck is too low. Pale, weak patches show the crown was exposed. Uneven color or texture shows the mower is not level.</p>
      <p>When these signs repeat after every mow, the issue is not the grass—it is the height setting and how the mower is maintaining it.</p>
