    <h1>How Mower Blade Sharpness Affects Grass</h1>

    <section>
      <h2>Sharp blades slice, dull blades tear</h2>
      <p>A sharp blade cuts through grass fibers cleanly in a single pass. A dull blade crushes the fibers first, then tears them apart through repeated impact.</p>
      <p>The difference is immediate. Sharp cuts leave smooth edges. Torn grass shows ragged, frayed tips.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Torn grass turns brown within hours</h2>
      <p>When grass is torn instead of cut, the damaged tissue dries out rapidly. The ragged edges turn white, then tan, then brown as moisture escapes from the exposed cells.</p>
      <p>This browning appears across the entire lawn within a day or two of mowing. The lawn looks dull even though it was just cut.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Ragged cuts invite disease</h2>
      <p>Clean cuts heal quickly and seal themselves against infection. Torn tissue stays open longer and provides entry points for fungal spores and bacteria.</p>
      <p>Grass that is repeatedly torn becomes more susceptible to leaf spot, rust, and other diseases that spread through surface contact.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Dull blades require more power</h2>
      <p>A dull blade forces the engine to work harder to maintain blade speed. The mower bogs down in thick grass and may stall completely in wet conditions.</p>
      <p>This increased load burns more fuel and generates more heat, both of which reduce the operational lifespan discussed in <a href="/tools-safety/how-long-lawn-tools-typically-last.html">How Long Lawn Tools Typically Last</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Grass loses water faster after rough cuts</h2>
      <p>Torn edges expose more surface area than clean cuts. This increases the rate at which each blade loses moisture to the air.</p>
      <p>During hot or dry periods, this added moisture loss stresses grass that is already struggling to maintain hydration.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Sharpness degrades gradually</h2>
      <p>A blade does not go from sharp to dull overnight. It loses its edge incrementally with each mowing, hitting small rocks, sticks, and hard soil that chip and round the cutting surface.</p>
      <p>Most operators do not notice the decline until the lawn starts looking consistently poor after every mowing.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Blade damage accelerates dullness</h2>
      <p>Nicks and bends in the blade create high points that wear down faster than the rest of the edge. These damaged sections tear grass while the rest of the blade still cuts cleanly.</p>
      <p>The result is uneven cut quality across a single pass, with some areas looking clean and others looking ragged.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Sharpening restores performance immediately</h2>
      <p>A properly sharpened blade cuts like new. The lawn shows the improvement within the first mowing, with grass tips staying green and uniform instead of turning brown.</p>
      <p>The restoration is complete and immediate. There is no gradual improvement period.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Frequent sharpening extends blade life</h2>
      <p>Sharpening removes less metal when done regularly than when done after severe dulling. A blade sharpened every few weeks lasts multiple seasons.</p>
      <p>A blade left dull for an entire season may need aggressive grinding to restore the edge, removing enough material to weaken the blade structure.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Sharpness affects more than grass appearance</h2>
      <p>Beyond visible browning, dull blades stress grass at the root level. Torn tissue requires more energy to repair, diverting resources from root growth and nutrient uptake.</p>
      <p>This hidden stress compounds over time, similar to how poor tool maintenance creates damage below the surface, as seen in <a href="/tools-safety/why-improper-aeration-hurts-soil.html">Why Improper Aeration Hurts Soil</a>.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The cut reveals the blade</h2>
      <p>Grass does not hide blade condition. It displays it immediately as either clean green tips or brown ragged edges.</p>
      <p>When browning appears consistently after every mowing, the blade is dull. The solution is sharpening, not adjusting height, changing mowing frequency, or adding fertilizer.</p>
