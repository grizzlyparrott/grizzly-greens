  <h1>Difference Between Spike and Core Aerators</h1>

  <h2>Both tools target the same surface problem</h2>
  <p>Spike and core aerators are used when the lawn surface resists normal function. Surface compression determines their effectiveness, and each tool interacts with that resistance in a different way.</p>
  <p>The ground either rebounds after disturbance or returns to the same hard feel.</p>

  <h2>Spike aerators displace soil without removing it</h2>
  <p>Spike aerators push into the ground and force soil aside. Material stays in place.</p>
  <p>The surface often looks punctured at first, then feels just as firm once the holes close.</p>

  <h2>Core aerators remove material from the surface</h2>
  <p>Core aerators extract plugs, leaving empty spaces behind. Compression is reduced instead of shifted.</p>
  <p>The lawn shows visible plugs and a softer feel that lasts longer underfoot.</p>

  <h2>Surface rebound separates the two outcomes</h2>
  <p>When soil springs back immediately, spike holes disappear without effect. Core holes linger long enough to matter.</p>
  <p>The difference appears as short-lived marks versus sustained surface change.</p>

  <h2>Repeated spike use can harden surrounding soil</h2>
  <p>Pushing soil aside repeatedly packs adjacent areas tighter. Compression increases around each hole.</p>
  <p>The lawn develops firm rings and uneven resistance across the surface.</p>

  <h2>Core removal creates uneven effort demands</h2>
  <p>Extracting plugs requires more force and handling. Fatigue builds faster.</p>
  <p>The strain pattern matches <a href="/tools-safety/why-improper-lifting-causes-back-injuries.html">Why Improper Lifting Causes Back Injuries</a>, where repetitive load adds up.</p>

  <h2>Experience determines how disturbance is applied</h2>
  <p>Experienced operators space passes evenly and avoid overworking the same zones.</p>
  <p>The smoother surface outcome reflects <a href="/tools-safety/how-experience-reduces-tool-damage.html">How Experience Reduces Tool Damage</a>, where control limits harm.</p>

  <h2>Continuous pressure persists without release</h2>
  <p>When soil closes immediately after disturbance, neither tool produces lasting change.</p>
  <p>Beyond that point, additional passes only add visible disruption.</p>

  <h2>The lawn reveals which tool mattered</h2>
  <p>Spike aeration leaves temporary marks and firm footing. Core aeration leaves plugs and a surface that stays open longer.</p>
  <p>The ground itself shows whether compression was actually reduced.</p>
