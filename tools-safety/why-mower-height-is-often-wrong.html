  <h1>Why Mower Height Is Often Wrong</h1>

  <h2>Mower height fails when too much surface is removed at once</h2>
  <p>Grass can absorb minor reductions without visible stress, but mower height is often set low enough to remove more surface than the plant can tolerate. Once too much leaf area is taken away, the lawn immediately looks thin and washed out.</p>

  <p>The cut area loses its rich color within hours.</p>

  <h2>Low cuts expose uneven ground instantly</h2>
  <p>When mower height is set too low, the blade follows every dip and rise in the soil. That creates scalped patches on high spots and untouched grass in low ones.</p>
  <p>The yard ends up with bare streaks and missed tufts after a single pass.</p>

  <h2>Repeated mowing locks in the wrong height</h2>
  <p>Once grass is cut too short, regrowth happens unevenly. Some areas stall while others stretch quickly.</p>
  <p>The surface becomes patchy between mows, even though the same height setting is used each time.</p>

  <h2>Short grass magnifies cutting damage</h2>
  <p>When little leaf remains, every cut matters more. Any tearing or drag becomes visible immediately.</p>
  <p>This is why damage linked to <a href="/tools-safety/how-mower-blade-sharpness-affects-grass.html">How Mower Blade Sharpness Affects Grass</a> shows up faster at lower heights.</p>

  <h2>Tool type influences how height mistakes spread</h2>
  <p>Powered mowers move fast enough to repeat the same height error across the entire yard before it’s noticed. Manual tools limit the spread simply by covering less ground per minute.</p>
  <p>The difference described in <a href="/tools-safety/difference-between-manual-and-powered-tools.html">Difference Between Manual and Powered Tools</a> becomes visible in how widespread the damage looks.</p>

  <h2>Soil firmness determines how forgiving height settings are</h2>
  <p>On firm or uneven soil, low mower settings transfer more impact to the grass. Blades ride closer to the surface instead of floating.</p>
  <p>This effect is especially obvious in lawns like those discussed in <a href="/lawn-basics/can-grass-grow-on-clay-soil.html">Can Grass Grow on Clay Soil</a>, where scalping appears faster.</p>

  <h2>Recurring crown removal accelerates damage</h2>
  <p>Once the same areas are cut too low repeatedly, grass fails to fill back in. Soil stays exposed and edges of bare spots expand.</p>
  <p>At that point, even higher settings no longer restore a uniform look.</p>

  <h2>Wrong height reveals itself in the finish, not the mower</h2>
  <p>Incorrect mower height does not require measurement to detect. The lawn shows it through discoloration, bare streaks, uneven texture, and stalled regrowth.</p>
  <p>When those signs repeat after every mow, the height is wrong regardless of how normal it feels to set it there.</p>
