  <h1>Why Expensive Tools Aren’t Always Better</h1>

  <h2>Price increases output, not accuracy</h2>
  <p>High-end tools deliver more force, speed, or coverage in the same amount of time. When that output cannot be guided precisely, it shows up as uneven cuts, torn edges, or patches that look scraped instead of clean.</p>
  <p>The lawn looks worked harder but not finished better.</p>

  <h2>More power reduces the margin for small errors</h2>
  <p>Powerful tools respond instantly to movement, so small hand shifts turn into sharp changes on the ground. This becomes obvious when straight passes wobble, edges dip suddenly, or the tool pulls sideways without warning.</p>
  <p>The surface records those slips permanently.</p>

  <h2>Advanced tools expose poor conditions immediately</h2>
  <p>Low light, uneven ground, or cluttered areas limit what the operator can see or feel. A high-output tool continues at full strength, leaving gouges, missed strips, or fresh scars where visibility dropped.</p>
  <p>The damage appears exactly where conditions were worst.</p>

  <h2>Long runtime encourages work past clean execution</h2>
  <p>Tools built to run longer remove natural stopping points, so work continues as focus fades. The end of a session is marked by sloppy overlap, wandering lines, and sections that look rushed compared to the start.</p>
  <p>The drop in quality is visible before the tool ever slows down.</p>

  <h2>Professional-grade tools demand professional surfaces</h2>
  <p>High-end equipment assumes flat ground and clear boundaries. In tight yards or uneven spaces, that mismatch shows up as bounce, chatter, or the tool fighting against the surface.</p>
  <p>The lawn bears the marks of that struggle.</p>

  <h2>Power source does not correct spatial limits</h2>
  <p>Electric tools feel smoother and gas tools feel stronger, but neither changes the shape of the yard. Tight corners, obstacles, and short runs still produce clipped spots, overlaps, or missed edges.</p>
  <p>The same flaws appear regardless of the engine.</p>

  <h2>Precise engagement disappears entirely</h2>
  <p>Once output exceeds what can be guided reliably, adjustments stop improving results. Slowing down only spreads mistakes, and every pass creates a new flaw next to the last.</p>
  <p>At that point, damage accumulates even as effort increases.</p>

  <h2>Better results come from matching tool scale to the yard</h2>
  <p>When a tool’s capability fits the space and conditions, work leaves consistent patterns and clean transitions. When it does not, the lawn shows forced lines, uneven texture, and visible correction marks.</p>
  <p>This is why expensive tools aren’t always better, and why the finished surface reveals whether the match was right.</p>
