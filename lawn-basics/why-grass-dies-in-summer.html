    <h1>Why Grass Dies in Summer</h1>

<h2>Summer damage usually starts as an energy problem</h2>
<p>Grass survives heat by staying ahead of its own maintenance costs. In mild weather, the plant produces enough energy to replace worn tissue, push new leaves, and maintain its roots. In summer heat, the balance shifts because the plant must spend more energy just to stay alive.</p>
<p>When the cost of maintaining living tissue rises faster than energy production, grass begins to shut down nonessential growth. The lawn can still look mostly normal at first, but it is operating on a shrinking margin that fails quickly when stress stacks up.</p>

<h2>Heat makes water loss faster than roots can replace it</h2>
<p>Summer air pulls moisture out of leaf tissue through transpiration. That process is normal, but the rate accelerates as temperatures rise and humidity drops. If the roots cannot supply water at the same pace, leaf tissue loses pressure, blades collapse, and the plant starts closing stomata to slow further loss.</p>
<p>Closing stomata reduces water loss, but it also reduces carbon intake. That is why heat and drought often act like a single problem even when the lawn is being watered.</p>

<h2>Shallow or stressed roots are the tipping point</h2>
<p>A lawn can tolerate short heat waves if roots are deep enough to access stable moisture. When roots are shallow, compacted, or weakened, the plant becomes dependent on the upper soil layer, which is the first place to dry out. Once that surface zone becomes unreliable, the grass has no buffer against temperature spikes.</p>
<p>In many yards, root weakness is not obvious until summer exposes it. The grass does not fail because the season is different; it fails because the roots were never positioned to handle the demand.</p>

<h2>Shade can help or hurt depending on what it changes</h2>
<p>Shade reduces surface temperature and can slow evaporation, which is why some shaded areas stay greener during heat. At the same time, shade reduces light intensity, limiting energy production and slowing recovery after mowing or traffic.</p>
<p>Whether shade protects the lawn or weakens it depends on the type of shade and how long it persists each day. The mechanisms behind that tradeoff are covered in <a href="how-shade-affects-grass-growth.html">How Shade Affects Grass Growth</a>.</p>

<h2>Night growth does not erase daytime stress</h2>
<p>Grass can rebuild and extend tissue when conditions are cooler, which is why recovery often looks better after a mild night. That recovery is limited if the plant spent the entire day defending itself instead of producing energy. Heat stress can also keep nighttime respiration high, which further reduces the net gain the plant can make while temperatures drop.</p>
<p>This is why the lawn can appear to improve briefly and then crash again during the next hot stretch. How growth timing works across the day is explained in <a href="does-grass-grow-at-night.html">Does Grass Grow at Night</a>.</p>

<h2>Some lawns are simply at the end of their functional life</h2>
<p>When a lawn has been thinned over years by repeated stress, the summer slump can become a final failure instead of a temporary setback. Older turf often has uneven density, weaker root structure, and less capacity to rebound from compaction, disease pressure, and mowing errors. Summer heat does not create those problems, but it is the season that exposes them.</p>
<p>If grass dies in the same areas every summer despite consistent care, the lawn may be past the point where it can recover evenly. The patterns that develop as turf ages are discussed in <a href="how-long-a-lawn-typically-lasts.html">How Long a Lawn Typically Lasts</a>.</p>

<h2>Why reseeding fails when timing and germination are ignored</h2>
<p>When summer damage leaves thin or bare areas, reseeding seems like the obvious fix. The issue is that seedlings need a stable moisture window and moderate temperatures long enough to establish roots. In heat, the surface dries too quickly, and germination becomes uneven or stops entirely.</p>
<p>Successful repair depends on understanding how long seeds take to emerge and what conditions they need to survive after sprouting. That timeline is outlined in <a href="how-long-it-takes-grass-to-germinate.html">How Long It Takes Grass to Germinate</a>.</p>

<h2>What “dead” grass usually means in summer</h2>
<p>Grass that looks dead in summer is sometimes dormant rather than truly killed. Dormancy is a defensive shutdown where leaves stop growing and turn brown to reduce energy and water demand. True death occurs when the crown and root system are damaged beyond the point of regrowth.</p>
<p>The difference matters because dormancy can recover when conditions improve, while dead turf requires replacement or reseeding. Summer becomes the season where that boundary is crossed when stress remains constant long enough that the plant cannot restart.</p>
