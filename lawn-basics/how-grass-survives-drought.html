    <h1>How Grass Survives Drought</h1>

<h2>Drought survival starts before water disappears</h2>
<p>Grass does not decide how well it will survive drought once rainfall stops. That outcome is largely determined beforehand by root depth, crown health, and stored energy. When moisture becomes limited, the plant can only work with what it already has in place.</p>
<p>Lawns that enter dry periods healthy and unstressed shift into survival mode smoothly. Weak lawns collapse quickly because they lack reserves to slow the damage.</p>

<h2>Growth shuts down to reduce water demand</h2>
<p>The first drought response is growth suppression. Grass reduces leaf expansion and limits new tissue production to cut water loss. Blades may fold, curl, or lose color as the plant prioritizes survival over appearance.</p>
<p>This shutdown is intentional. Producing new tissue during drought would increase surface area and accelerate dehydration.</p>

<h2>Stomata control becomes the main defense</h2>
<p>Grass regulates water loss by closing stomata, the pores that allow gas exchange. Closing them reduces transpiration but also limits carbon intake. As photosynthesis slows, energy production drops, forcing the plant to rely on stored carbohydrates.</p>
<p>The longer drought persists, the more those reserves are depleted. Survival depends on how much energy was stored before stress began.</p>

<h2>Crowns and roots are protected at the expense of leaves</h2>
<p>During drought, grass sacrifices leaf tissue to protect the crown and root system. Leaves may turn brown or appear dead while the growing point remains alive below the surface. This strategy allows regrowth once moisture returns.</p>
<p>When crowns dry out or roots collapse, survival ends. At that point, recovery requires replacement rather than patience.</p>

<h2>Mowing height determines how much stress grass can absorb</h2>
<p>Cutting grass too short before or during drought removes stored energy and exposes soil to heat. Short turf dries faster, heats up more quickly, and loses its buffer against moisture loss.</p>
<p>Understanding where the danger line sits is critical, especially under dry conditions. That threshold is explained in <a href="how-short-is-too-short-to-cut-grass.html">How Short Is Too Short to Cut Grass</a>.</p>

<h2>Shade changes drought stress in complex ways</h2>
<p>Shaded lawns often lose water more slowly because surface temperatures stay lower. At the same time, reduced light limits energy production, which can weaken drought resistance if shade is excessive.</p>
<p>Grass selection matters in these conditions. Species adapted to low light tolerate drought differently than sun grasses, a distinction covered in <a href="best-grass-for-shady-lawns.html">Best Grass for Shady Lawns</a>.</p>

<h2>Why some lawns thin out instead of fully dying</h2>
<p>Partial survival is common during drought. Grass may persist in patches where roots reach deeper moisture while nearby areas fail. This creates thin, uneven coverage rather than total loss.</p>
<p>When moisture returns, those surviving plants spread slowly if conditions allow. How to rebuild density after stress is covered in <a href="how-to-thicken-a-thin-lawn.html">How to Thicken a Thin Lawn</a>.</p>

<h2>When drought damage becomes irreversible</h2>
<p>Drought crosses from survivable to fatal when crowns desiccate or roots die back beyond recovery. This usually happens when dry conditions combine with heat, mowing stress, or compacted soil.</p>
<p>At that stage, waiting will not restore coverage. The lawn must be rebuilt rather than nursed back.</p>

<h2>Deciding whether to recover or restart</h2>
<p>After prolonged drought, the key question is whether living crowns remain. If grass greens up with water and cooler temperatures, recovery is possible. If bare soil remains unchanged, survival has already failed.</p>
<p>When recovery is no longer an option, the process of resetting the lawn is outlined in <a href="how-to-start-over-with-a-dead-lawn.html">How to Start Over With a Dead Lawn</a>.</p>
