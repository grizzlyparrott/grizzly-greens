    <h1>Mistakes That Kill New Grass</h1>

<h2>New grass dies from overload, not neglect</h2>
<p>Most new grass does not die because it was ignored. It dies because it was asked to handle too much too soon. Weak roots cannot buffer stress, so mistakes compound rapidly.</p>
<p>Early success depends on protecting recovery, not pushing growth.</p>

<h2>Allowing traffic before roots establish</h2>
<p>Walking on new grass compresses soil and disrupts fragile roots. Even light use can break root-to-soil contact during early stages.</p>
<p>Understanding when grass can tolerate pressure prevents this failure, as explained in <a href="can-you-walk-on-new-grass.html">Can You Walk on New Grass</a>.</p>

<h2>Inconsistent watering causes silent failure</h2>
<p>New grass relies on shallow roots and surface moisture. Missed watering allows roots to dry before they anchor.</p>
<p>Short dry cycles kill roots even if the grass remains green briefly afterward.</p>

<h2>Overwatering reduces oxygen at the root zone</h2>
<p>Saturated soil limits oxygen exchange. Roots slow or stop growing even though water is present.</p>
<p>This often looks like poor establishment rather than drowning.</p>

<h2>Mowing too early drains energy reserves</h2>
<p>New grass needs leaf area to build roots. Early mowing removes the tissue responsible for energy production.</p>
<p>Once reserves drop, recovery stalls.</p>

<h2>Heat stress arrives faster than expected</h2>
<p>Young grass has limited ability to regulate temperature and moisture loss. Heat can overwhelm it quickly even when mature lawns nearby survive.</p>
<p>How long grass can tolerate dry and hot conditions explains this vulnerability, as outlined in <a href="how-long-grass-can-go-without-water.html">How Long Grass Can Go Without Water</a>.</p>

<h2>Surface crusting blocks emergence and rooting</h2>
<p>Compacted or crusted soil prevents roots from penetrating downward. Grass may sprout but never anchor.</p>
<p>This leads to sudden collapse after initial growth.</p>

<h2>Texture changes signal stress accumulation</h2>
<p>New grass often changes texture before it fails. Blades may become thin, soft, or uneven as energy is redirected from growth to survival.</p>
<p>These changes are part of a longer pattern described in <a href="why-grass-changes-texture-over-time.html">Why Grass Changes Texture Over Time</a>.</p>

<h2>Assuming green means healthy</h2>
<p>New grass can remain green while roots are dying. Color alone is not a reliable indicator of establishment.</p>
<p>By the time discoloration appears, recovery options may be limited.</p>

<h2>Stacking multiple stresses at once</h2>
<p>Traffic, mowing, heat, and watering mistakes rarely occur alone. When combined, they exceed what young grass can tolerate.</p>
<p>Each stress reduces the margin for error of the next.</p>

<h2>New grass needs protection, not correction</h2>
<p>The most common mistake is trying to fix new grass instead of shielding it. Early intervention often increases stress rather than reducing it.</p>
<p>New grass survives when pressure is minimized until roots take over the workload.</p>
