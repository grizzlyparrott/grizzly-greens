    <h1>How to Tell If Grass Is Dormant or Dead</h1>

<h2>Dormancy is a survival shutdown, not failure</h2>
<p>Dormant grass is alive but inactive. When conditions become unfavorable, usually from heat, drought, or cold, grass reduces growth to conserve energy and water. Leaves lose color and turn brown, but the crown and roots remain intact.</p>
<p>This response allows grass to pause without dying. Once conditions improve, dormant turf can resume growth without reseeding.</p>

<h2>Dead grass has lost its growing point</h2>
<p>Grass is considered dead when the crown is damaged beyond recovery. The crown is the growth junction between leaves and roots, and if it dries out, freezes, rots, or is physically destroyed, regrowth becomes impossible.</p>
<p>Unlike dormancy, death is permanent. No amount of watering or waiting will restore growth once the crown is gone.</p>

<h2>Color alone is not a reliable indicator</h2>
<p>Both dormant and dead grass can appear straw brown. Color change is simply the loss of chlorophyll and does not indicate whether the plant is still viable.</p>
<p>Some lawns even shift to darker green before shutting down, depending on nutrient balance and stress response. That contrast is explained further in <a href="what-makes-grass-turn-dark-green.html">What Makes Grass Turn Dark Green</a>.</p>

<h2>The tug test reveals crown survival</h2>
<p>One of the simplest ways to tell the difference is to gently pull on the grass. Dormant grass remains anchored and resists removal because roots are still attached. Dead grass pulls out easily, often coming up with little or no root structure.</p>
<p>This test works because living roots maintain grip even when top growth has stopped.</p>

<h2>Moisture response separates dormancy from death</h2>
<p>Dormant grass responds slowly but noticeably when watered and exposed to favorable temperatures. Over days or weeks, color and density begin to return.</p>
<p>Dead grass shows no change. The surface remains bare or brittle regardless of moisture.</p>

<h2>Soil contact matters more than surface appearance</h2>
<p>Grass that grows in compromised surfaces such as gravel or rocky fill struggles to maintain crowns and roots. In those environments, stress accumulates faster and recovery windows are shorter.</p>
<p>Whether grass can survive those conditions at all is discussed in <a href="can-grass-grow-through-rocks-or-gravel.html">Can Grass Grow Through Rocks or Gravel</a>.</p>

<h2>Timing determines the diagnosis</h2>
<p>Dormancy follows predictable seasonal patterns. Cool-season grasses go dormant in summer heat, while warm-season grasses shut down during cold. Death does not follow a schedule and often appears after prolonged or combined stress.</p>
<p>If browning occurs during a normal dormancy window, patience is usually warranted. Outside those windows, closer inspection is needed.</p>

<h2>Why repeated dormancy can lead to death</h2>
<p>Dormancy itself does not harm grass, but repeated shutdowns without recovery weaken energy reserves. Each cycle reduces the plant’s ability to protect its crown during the next stress event.</p>
<p>Eventually, what begins as dormancy crosses into irreversible damage.</p>

<h2>Deciding whether to wait or replace</h2>
<p>If crowns remain intact and grass resists pulling, waiting is usually the correct choice. Recovery may be slow, but it is possible.</p>
<p>If grass lifts easily, shows no response to moisture, and leaves behind bare soil, replacement is the only path forward. Dormancy can recover. Death cannot.</p>
