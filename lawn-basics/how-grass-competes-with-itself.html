    <h1>How Grass Competes With Itself</h1>

<h2>Grass competes even in weed-free lawns</h2>
<p>Competition does not require weeds. Grass plants compete with each other whenever roots overlap and resources are limited.</p>
<p>This internal competition determines which plants survive stress and which thin out.</p>

<h2>Roots compete before blades do</h2>
<p>Below the surface, roots intersect and compete for oxygen, water, and nutrients. When resources decline, weaker root systems lose access first.</p>
<p>Surface decline usually follows root failure.</p>

<h2>High density increases competition pressure</h2>
<p>As grass thickens, demand increases faster than supply. Even healthy lawns eventually reach a point where plants limit each other.</p>
<p>Competition intensifies during heat and drought.</p>

<h2>Uneven resources create winners and losers</h2>
<p>Small differences in soil structure, moisture, or shade give certain plants an advantage. Those plants expand while neighbors weaken.</p>
<p>This process creates patchiness without external invasion.</p>

<h2>Competition accelerates thinning under stress</h2>
<p>When stress reduces available resources, grass cannot support existing density. Plants sacrifice neighbors to preserve crowns.</p>
<p>The result is gradual thinning rather than sudden collapse.</p>

<h2>Thickening requires managing competition</h2>
<p>Adding seed alone does not solve competition. Existing plants still control access to soil and light.</p>
<p>How density can be rebuilt depends on easing internal competition, as explained in <a href="/lawn-basics/how-to-thicken-a-thin-lawn.html">How to Thicken a Thin Lawn</a>.</p>

<h2>Heat magnifies competitive losses</h2>
<p>During summer, water demand rises sharply. Roots that lose access first fail quickly.</p>
<p>This process explains why lawns thin or die under heat, as explained in <a href="/lawn-basics/why-grass-dies-in-summer.html">Why Grass Dies in Summer</a>.</p>

<h2>Edge stress shifts competitive balance</h2>
<p>Along hard edges, competition becomes extreme. Heat, compaction, and moisture loss give some plants an advantage while others fail.</p>
<p>This is why edge zones collapse faster, as explained in <a href="/lawn-basics/why-grass-dies-along-driveways.html">Why Grass Dies Along Driveways</a>.</p>

<h2>Grass competes to preserve the colony</h2>
<p>Individual plants fail so the overall lawn can survive. Competition redistributes limited resources to the strongest crowns.</p>
<p>Understanding this process explains why lawns thin before they die.</p>
