    <h1>Why Grass Fails in New Construction Yards</h1>

<h2>Construction destroys soil before grass is planted</h2>
<p>During construction, soil is stripped, buried, compacted, and driven over repeatedly. The original structure that allowed air, water, and roots to move is eliminated.</p>
<p>Grass is installed into soil that no longer functions like soil.</p>

<h2>Compaction is extreme and continuous</h2>
<p>Heavy equipment compresses soil particles together until pore space collapses. Oxygen exchange becomes minimal and root expansion is physically blocked.</p>
<p>Even after planting, the soil remains hostile to root growth.</p>

<h2>Topsoil is often missing or diluted</h2>
<p>In many new yards, topsoil is removed or replaced with thin fill. Organic matter and microbial life are largely absent.</p>
<p>Grass planted into this layer has no buffer against stress.</p>

<h2>Water cannot move or be stored correctly</h2>
<p>Compacted subsoil sheds water at the surface while remaining dry below. Grass appears watered but roots never gain access to stable moisture.</p>
<p>This creates chronic stress even with frequent irrigation.</p>

<h2>Grass cannot spread into damaged zones</h2>
<p>Even spreading grasses fail when surrounding soil prevents root anchoring. Stolons and rhizomes stop at compacted boundaries.</p>
<p>Whether grass can fill gaps depends on rooting success, as explained in <a href="/lawn-basics/can-grass-spread-on-its-own.html">Can Grass Spread on Its Own</a>.</p>

<h2>Traffic continues after installation</h2>
<p>Foot traffic, equipment access, and landscaping work continue after grass is installed. This flattens seedlings and further compresses soil.</p>
<p>How flattened turf can sometimes recover is explained in <a href="/lawn-basics/how-to-fix-flattened-grass.html">How to Fix Flattened Grass</a>.</p>

<h2>Color changes can be misleading</h2>
<p>Grass in new construction yards may turn dark green briefly as growth slows under stress. This can be mistaken for health.</p>
<p>What dark green color often signals is explained in <a href="/lawn-basics/what-makes-grass-turn-dark-green.html">What Makes Grass Turn Dark Green</a>.</p>

<h2>Failure appears delayed, not immediate</h2>
<p>Newly installed grass may look acceptable for weeks or months. Failure often appears during the first heat or drought cycle.</p>
<p>By then, root systems are already compromised.</p>

<h2>New construction lawns fail structurally</h2>
<p>Grass fails in new construction yards because soil systems are broken before planting begins.</p>
<p>Without rebuilding soil function, grass survival is temporary at best.</p>
