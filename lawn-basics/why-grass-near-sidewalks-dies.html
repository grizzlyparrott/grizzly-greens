    <h1>Why Grass Near Sidewalks Dies</h1>

<h2>Sidewalks create extreme microclimates</h2>
<p>Concrete and asphalt absorb heat during the day and release it back into surrounding soil and air. Grass growing next to sidewalks is exposed to higher temperatures for longer periods than the rest of the lawn.</p>
<p>This constant heat load accelerates water loss and pushes grass closer to its stress limits.</p>

<h2>Heat reflection dries soil faster than watering can replace it</h2>
<p>Even when irrigation is adequate, soil near sidewalks dries faster due to radiant heat. Moisture evaporates before roots can absorb it, leaving grass in a daily deficit.</p>
<p>This is why edge areas often fail first during heat waves.</p>

<h2>Soil near pavement is often compacted and shallow</h2>
<p>Construction around sidewalks compresses soil and limits rooting depth. Grass roots in these zones struggle to expand and access oxygen.</p>
<p>Shallow, compacted soil removes the buffer grass needs to survive temperature swings.</p>

<h2>Foot traffic concentrates along edges</h2>
<p>People naturally walk near sidewalks, concentrating foot traffic in the same narrow strip of turf. Repeated pressure damages roots and further compacts soil.</p>
<p>The mechanics of this damage are explained in <a href="how-foot-traffic-damages-grass.html">How Foot Traffic Damages Grass</a>.</p>

<h2>Rapid decline often looks sudden but is not</h2>
<p>Grass near sidewalks often looks fine until stress crosses a threshold. One hot day can trigger visible collapse after weeks of hidden strain.</p>
<p>This pattern explains why turf can look healthy one day and damaged the next, as described in <a href="why-grass-looks-good-one-day-and-bad-the-next.html">Why Grass Looks Good One Day and Bad the Next</a>.</p>

<h2>Cold stress adds damage in winter climates</h2>
<p>In colder regions, sidewalks worsen freeze-thaw cycles. Heat retention during the day followed by rapid nighttime cooling increases crown damage.</p>
<p>Grass exposed to these cycles may suffer winter injury even when nearby turf survives, a process discussed in <a href="can-grass-survive-frost.html">Can Grass Survive Frost</a>.</p>

<h2>Edges receive less effective watering</h2>
<p>Sprinkler coverage often overshoots pavement, wasting water that never reaches soil. The narrow strip next to sidewalks receives less usable moisture despite frequent irrigation.</p>
<p>This uneven distribution compounds heat and compaction stress.</p>

<h2>Recovery is slower at the lawn’s margins</h2>
<p>Even when conditions improve, grass near sidewalks recovers more slowly. Root systems are weaker, and stress returns faster during the next heat or traffic event.</p>
<p>This leads to repeated failure cycles unless conditions change.</p>

<h2>Why replacement alone rarely works</h2>
<p>Reseeding or resodding edge areas without addressing heat, compaction, and traffic usually fails. New grass encounters the same stresses immediately.</p>
<p>Lasting improvement requires reducing those stresses rather than simply replacing plants.</p>

<h2>Sidewalk damage is structural, not cosmetic</h2>
<p>Grass dies near sidewalks because the environment favors stress over recovery. Heat, compaction, and traffic stack together in a way turf is poorly equipped to handle.</p>
<p>Understanding these edge conditions explains why the problem repeats and why it is so difficult to fix without broader changes.</p>
