    <h1>Why Grass Dies Along Driveways</h1>

<h2>Driveways create extreme edge conditions</h2>
<p>Grass along driveways grows in a narrow strip where environmental stress is amplified. Heat, compaction, and moisture loss all concentrate at the boundary.</p>
<p>What survives in open lawn often fails at this edge.</p>

<h2>Heat reflection raises tissue temperature</h2>
<p>Concrete and asphalt absorb heat and radiate it back toward nearby turf. Leaf temperature rises beyond ambient air temperature.</p>
<p>This increases transpiration and accelerates dehydration during warm weather.</p>

<h2>Soil compaction restricts root function</h2>
<p>Driveway construction compresses soil beneath and beside the slab. Oxygen movement and water infiltration decline.</p>
<p>Roots remain shallow and weak, limiting recovery capacity.</p>

<h2>Moisture drains away from hard edges</h2>
<p>Water runs off hard surfaces instead of soaking in. The soil strip next to driveways dries faster than surrounding lawn.</p>
<p>Even frequent irrigation may never penetrate deeply enough.</p>

<h2>Salt and debris add chronic stress</h2>
<p>Deicing salts, vehicle residue, and runoff concentrate along driveway edges. These compounds disrupt root uptake and soil biology.</p>
<p>Stress accumulates over time rather than appearing immediately.</p>

<h2>Grass establishment method affects survival</h2>
<p>Thin root systems fail faster under edge stress. Pre-established sod may survive longer than seed in these zones.</p>
<p>Choosing between methods depends on scale and conditions, as explained in <a href="/lawn-basics/is-sod-or-seed-better-for-small-lawns.html">Is Sod or Seed Better for Small Lawns</a>.</p>

<h2>Plugs and sod behave differently at edges</h2>
<p>Plugs and sod introduce mature roots, while seed must establish from scratch. In hostile edge zones, establishment method matters.</p>
<p>The structural differences are explained in <a href="/lawn-basics/difference-between-sod-seed-and-plugs.html">Difference Between Sod Seed and Plugs</a>.</p>

<h2>Edge failure often spreads inward</h2>
<p>Once grass dies along the driveway, exposed soil heats faster and dries deeper. This pushes stress into adjacent turf.</p>
<p>Without correction, the dead strip widens each season.</p>

<h2>Driveway grass fails from compounded stress</h2>
<p>No single factor kills grass along driveways. Heat, compaction, moisture loss, and contamination work together.</p>
<p>Unless those conditions are addressed, replacement alone does not last.</p>
