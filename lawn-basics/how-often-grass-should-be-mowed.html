    <h1>How Often Grass Should Be Mowed</h1>

<h2>Why mowing on a schedule rarely works</h2>
<p>Most people start out mowing on a fixed schedule, like every Saturday or every other week. At first that feels organized, but over time the lawn starts sending mixed signals. Some weeks the grass barely grows, and other weeks it feels like it’s out of control.</p>
<p>The lawn doesn’t follow the calendar. It reacts to conditions, which is why a rigid schedule eventually creates uneven results.</p>

<h2>What the lawn tells you between cuts</h2>
<p>When grass is ready to be mowed, it starts looking uneven rather than just taller. You’ll notice certain areas leaning over or standing out above the rest of the yard. That’s usually the first sign it’s time.</p>
<p>If the lawn still looks level and upright, mowing usually does more harm than good. Waiting until the yard shows unevenness keeps cuts cleaner.</p>

<h2>Why some areas always seem ahead of the rest</h2>
<p>Most lawns never grow evenly across the whole yard. Sections near water, sunlight, or shelter often take off faster than others. This makes the lawn look messy even when part of it is fine.</p>
<p>These differences are normal and repeat themselves year after year. <a href="why-grass-grows-faster-in-some-areas.html">Why Grass Grows Faster in Some Areas</a> explains why those spots always lead the pack.</p>

<h2>How mowing affects flattened or laid-over grass</h2>
<p>After rain or heavy use, grass often lays flat instead of standing upright. Mowing at that point can leave behind uneven patches that look half-cut. The lawn appears rough even though it was just mowed.</p>
<p>Letting grass dry and lift back up usually solves the problem. <a href="how-to-fix-flattened-grass.html">How to Fix Flattened Grass</a> shows how to restore an even look before cutting.</p>

<h2>Why weather changes mowing frequency</h2>
<p>Rainfall and temperature shifts directly change how fast the lawn grows. Wet stretches push growth quickly, while dry periods slow everything down. Mowing needs follow those changes.</p>
<p>Trying to keep the same routine through different weather usually leads to overcutting or scalping. <a href="how-rainfall-patterns-affect-lawns.html">How Rainfall Patterns Affect Lawns</a> explains how these swings shape growth.</p>

<h2>Finding a rhythm that works long term</h2>
<p>Over time, most homeowners settle into a flexible rhythm instead of a strict plan. The mower comes out when the lawn looks uneven, not when the calendar says so. This approach keeps the yard looking steadier.</p>
<p>Paying attention to how the lawn responds week to week leads to fewer problems and cleaner cuts. Consistency comes from observation, not rigid scheduling.</p>
