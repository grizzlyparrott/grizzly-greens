    <h1>How to Prepare Grass for Winter</h1>

<h2>Winter damage is determined before cold arrives</h2>
<p>Grass does not fail in winter because temperatures drop overnight. Damage occurs because crowns, roots, and energy reserves were not protected during the final active growing period.</p>
<p>Preparation is about locking in survival capacity before growth slows and repair becomes impossible.</p>

<h2>Roots and crowns become the priority</h2>
<p>As temperatures fall, grass shifts resources away from leaf production and toward roots and crowns. These structures determine whether the plant survives dormancy and regrows in spring.</p>
<p>Understanding how roots behave seasonally explains why late stress has long consequences, as outlined in <a href="/lawn-basics/how-grass-roots-grow.html">How Grass Roots Grow</a>.</p>

<h2>Mowing height controls insulation and exposure</h2>
<p>Grass cut too short going into winter exposes crowns to temperature swings and soil freezing. Excessively tall grass, however, can mat down and trap moisture.</p>
<p>Finding the balance between protection and airflow depends on timing and growth rate, which is explained in <a href="/lawn-basics/how-often-grass-should-be-mowed.html">How Often Grass Should Be Mowed</a>.</p>

<h2>Water stress continues even as growth slows</h2>
<p>Cold weather reduces evaporation, but roots still require moisture to remain functional. Dry soil entering winter increases the risk of root dieback and delayed spring recovery.</p>
<p>How long grass can tolerate limited moisture helps frame this risk, as explained in <a href="/lawn-basics/how-long-grass-can-go-without-water.html">How Long Grass Can Go Without Water</a>.</p>

<h2>Energy reserves determine winter survival</h2>
<p>Grass enters winter with a fixed supply of stored carbohydrates. These reserves fuel respiration during dormancy and power early spring growth.</p>
<p>Late-season stress drains these reserves and leaves the plant unable to restart when temperatures rise.</p>

<h2>Yellowing often signals stress, not death</h2>
<p>Grass commonly turns yellow as chlorophyll production slows and nutrients are relocated to roots. This color change is part of the shutdown process.</p>
<p>Distinguishing protective yellowing from fatal decline is explained in <a href="/lawn-basics/why-grass-turns-yellow.html">Why Grass Turns Yellow</a>.</p>

<h2>Traffic and compaction compound cold damage</h2>
<p>Frozen or saturated soil compresses easily. Foot traffic and equipment use damage crowns and restrict oxygen movement when recovery is no longer possible.</p>
<p>Winter preparation includes minimizing pressure during vulnerable conditions.</p>

<h2>Some lawns cannot overwinter successfully</h2>
<p>Lawns with severe crown loss, shallow roots, or compacted soil may not survive winter regardless of care. Cold simply finishes damage that has already occurred.</p>
<p>Recognizing when survival is no longer realistic is covered in <a href="/lawn-basics/when-grass-is-beyond-saving.html">When Grass Is Beyond Saving</a>.</p>

<h2>Preparation preserves recovery potential</h2>
<p>Winter survival does not guarantee a perfect lawn in spring. It ensures living crowns and roots remain capable of regrowth.</p>
<p>Grass that enters winter protected may look dormant, but it retains the ability to return when conditions allow.</p>
