    <h1>Why Grass Turns Brown</h1>

<h2>What brown grass biologically represents</h2>
<p>Brown grass indicates that active photosynthesis has largely stopped. Unlike yellowing, which reflects reduced chlorophyll, browning occurs when leaf tissue dries, collapses, or is intentionally abandoned by the plant.</p>
<section class="related-guides"><h2>Related guides</h2><ul class="related-list"><li><a href="/lawn-basics/warm-season-vs-cool-season-grasses-explained.html">Warm Season vs Cool Season Grasses Explained</a></li><li><a href="/lawn-basics/how-to-start-over-with-a-dead-lawn.html">How to Start Over With a Dead Lawn</a></li><li><a href="/lawn-basics/can-grass-heal-itself.html">Can Grass Heal Itself</a></li><li><a href="/watering-irrigation/why-wind-increases-water-loss.html">Why Wind Increases Water Loss</a></li></ul></section>

<p>This does not automatically mean the grass is dead. In many cases, browning is a survival response where the plant sacrifices leaf tissue to protect the crown and roots.</p>
<p>The critical distinction is whether browning is part of dormancy or the result of structural failure.</p>

<h2>Severe water deficit and tissue dehydration</h2>
<p>Extended drought causes cells to lose water faster than they can replenish it. Once dehydration crosses a threshold, leaf tissue cannot maintain structure and turns brown.</p>
<p>Grass responds by shutting down leaf metabolism to reduce water loss. The crown remains alive if dehydration is not prolonged.</p>
<p>This type of browning often appears uniform across exposed areas and coincides with high temperatures and low humidity.</p>

<h2>Dormancy as a protective mechanism</h2>
<p>Many grasses enter dormancy under extreme heat or cold. Dormant grass turns brown because chlorophyll production stops and leaves senesce.</p>
<p>The crown remains viable, storing carbohydrates until conditions improve.</p>
<p>Dormant browning is reversible, but recovery depends on how long dormancy lasts and whether the crown stays hydrated.</p>

<h2>Root failure and vascular shutdown</h2>
<p>When roots are damaged by compaction, overwatering, or disease, water transport to leaves collapses.</p>
<p>Leaf tissue dries even when soil moisture is present, producing browning that does not reverse quickly.</p>
<p>This form of browning often spreads in irregular patches.</p>

<h2>Mowing-related browning</h2>
<p>Scalping removes most photosynthetic tissue and exposes crowns to heat and desiccation.</p>
<p>Repeated low cuts exhaust carbohydrate reserves, preventing leaf regeneration.</p>
<p>Browning after mowing often follows a sharp, uneven pattern tied to mower height.</p>

<h2>Disease and pest involvement</h2>
<p>Pathogens disrupt water transport or destroy leaf tissue directly.</p>
<p>Root diseases cause browning through indirect dehydration, while foliar diseases damage tissue outright.</p>
<p>Progressive spread and defined margins often distinguish biological causes from environmental stress.</p>

<h2>Environmental heat loading</h2>
<p>Surfaces such as pavement raise soil temperatures beyond tolerance levels.</p>
<p>Root enzymes fail at high temperatures, cutting off water flow even in moist soil.</p>
<p>Browning near hardscapes is common under these conditions.</p>

<h2>How browning patterns differ by cause</h2>
<p>Uniform browning often signals dormancy or widespread drought.</p>
<p>Patchy or expanding browning suggests root or disease issues.</p>
<p>Timing relative to weather, mowing, or irrigation changes provides essential context.</p>

<h2>Recovery expectations</h2>
<p>Dormant grass can recover within weeks once conditions improve.</p>
<p>Root damage recovery is slower and may require partial regrowth.</p>
<p>Dead tissue does not recover and must be replaced.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Brown grass is not automatically dead, but it indicates advanced stress.</p>
<p>Determining whether the crown is alive matters more than leaf color alone.</p>
