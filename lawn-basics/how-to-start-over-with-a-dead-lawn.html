    <h1>How to Start Over With a Dead Lawn</h1>

<h2>Starting over is a structural reset</h2>
<p>A dead lawn cannot be fixed by surface treatments. Restarting means rebuilding soil conditions, root access, and growth timing from the ground up.</p>
<p>The goal is not appearance, but restoring a system capable of sustaining grass long term.</p>

<h2>Dead grass must be cleared or neutralized</h2>
<p>Old turf, thatch, and decaying roots interfere with seed-to-soil contact and moisture movement. Leaving them in place creates barriers for new growth.</p>
<p>Removal or breakdown is necessary before establishment can succeed.</p>

<h2>Soil damage is usually the original cause</h2>
<p>Most dead lawns failed because soil compacted, oxygen flow collapsed, or moisture movement became unstable. Restarting without addressing soil repeats the same failure.</p>
<p>Correcting structure is more important than choosing seed.</p>

<h2>Foot traffic often finishes weakened lawns</h2>
<p>Repeated pressure compresses soil and damages crowns beyond recovery. High-traffic areas fail first and remain bare longest.</p>
<p>How this damage accumulates is explained in <a href="/lawn-basics/how-foot-traffic-damages-grass.html">How Foot Traffic Damages Grass</a>.</p>

<h2>Competition must be eliminated early</h2>
<p>New grass seedlings are weak and easily outcompeted by weeds or surviving turf fragments. Competition steals light, water, and space during the most fragile phase.</p>
<p>Grass also competes with itself when density is uneven, a process explained in <a href="/lawn-basics/how-grass-competes-with-itself.html">How Grass Competes With Itself</a>.</p>

<h2>Timing determines success more than effort</h2>
<p>Grass establishes best when temperatures support root growth without extreme heat or cold. Planting outside this window increases failure risk regardless of care.</p>
<p>Choosing the correct window is explained in <a href="/lawn-basics/best-time-of-year-to-overseed-grass.html">Best Time of Year to Overseed Grass</a>.</p>

<h2>Early growth prioritizes roots, not blades</h2>
<p>New grass invests energy below ground before producing visible top growth. This phase determines long-term survival.</p>
<p>Surface patience is required while roots establish.</p>

<h2>Uneven establishment is normal at first</h2>
<p>Some areas will germinate faster due to micro-variations in moisture and soil contact. This does not indicate failure.</p>
<p>Uniformity improves as roots spread and density increases.</p>

<h2>Restarting works when limits are respected</h2>
<p>Starting over succeeds when soil is corrected, competition is controlled, and timing favors recovery.</p>
<p>Ignoring any of those limits recreates the same conditions that killed the lawn the first time.</p>
