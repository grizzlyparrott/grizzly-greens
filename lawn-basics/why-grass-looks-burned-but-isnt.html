    <h1>Why Grass Looks Burned but Isn’t</h1>

<h2>Burned appearance usually reflects stress, not death</h2>
<p>Grass often appears burned when water movement, pigment production, or growth rate is disrupted. Leaf tips dry out, edges brown, and color fades even though crowns remain alive.</p>
<p>This visual damage is reversible as long as roots and crowns are intact.</p>

<h2>Water imbalance causes rapid discoloration</h2>
<p>When grass loses water faster than it can replace it, cells collapse and reflect less light. This creates a scorched look without actual heat damage.</p>
<p>Even brief moisture stress can trigger this response.</p>

<h2>Mowing can intensify the burned look</h2>
<p>Cutting removes leaf tissue that shades lower blades and reduces transpiration. If mowing occurs during stress, exposed tissue dries quickly.</p>
<p>How mowing timing and frequency influence stress tolerance is explained in <a href="/lawn-basics/how-often-grass-should-be-mowed.html">How Often Grass Should Be Mowed</a>.</p>

<h2>Compacted soil mimics drought damage</h2>
<p>In compacted soil, roots struggle to access water even when moisture is present. Grass shows drought symptoms despite irrigation.</p>
<p>This hidden cause is explained in <a href="/lawn-basics/can-grass-grow-in-compacted-soil.html">Can Grass Grow in Compacted Soil</a>.</p>

<h2>Chlorophyll production slows under stress</h2>
<p>Stress reduces chlorophyll synthesis before tissue dies. Green pigment fades, revealing brown or tan tones underneath.</p>
<p>This change is a protective slowdown, not immediate failure.</p>

<h2>Leaf tissue sacrifices itself first</h2>
<p>Grass prioritizes crown and root survival. Older leaf tissue dries out and dies back to reduce water loss.</p>
<p>As long as the growing point survives, regrowth remains possible.</p>

<h2>Patterns often follow exposure lines</h2>
<p>Burn-like discoloration frequently appears in stripes or patches based on slope, sun exposure, and airflow.</p>
<p>These patterns reflect environmental differences rather than uniform damage.</p>

<h2>Recovery depends on stress duration</h2>
<p>Short stress periods cause cosmetic damage that reverses quickly. Extended stress drains reserves and delays regrowth.</p>
<p>The longer the stress lasts, the closer appearance moves toward actual damage.</p>

<h2>Burned-looking grass is often still alive</h2>
<p>Grass that looks burned is frequently alive below the surface.</p>
<p>True death occurs only when crowns dry out or roots collapse beyond recovery.</p>
