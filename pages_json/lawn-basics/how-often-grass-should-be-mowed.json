  "content_html": "<h1>How Often Grass Should Be Mowed</h1>\n\n<h2>Why mowing frequency matters biologically</h2>\n<p>Mowing removes photosynthetic tissue. Every cut reduces the leaf area responsible for carbohydrate production.</p>\n<p>Grass survives mowing because growth points are located near the crown, but recovery depends on how much leaf area remains after each cut.</p>\n<p>Mowing frequency determines whether the plant maintains energy balance or enters repeated recovery mode.</p>\n\n<h2>Growth rate, not time, sets mowing needs</h2>\n<p>Grass grows in response to temperature, moisture, and light. These factors change constantly.</p>\n<p>Rapid growth produces excess leaf tissue that can be removed without stress.</p>\n<p>Slow growth means each cut removes a higher percentage of the plant’s energy-producing surface.</p>\n\n<h2>Seasonal growth patterns</h2>\n<p>Spring often produces the fastest growth due to moderate temperatures and adequate moisture.</p>\n<p>Summer heat slows growth in cool-season grasses, increasing mowing stress.</p>\n<p>Warm-season grasses peak later, shifting mowing demand to hotter months.</p>\n\n<h2>Carbohydrate storage and recovery</h2>\n<p>Grass stores energy in roots and crowns.</p>\n<p>Frequent severe cuts force the plant to draw down these reserves.</p>\n<p>When reserves fall too low, regrowth slows and thinning begins.</p>\n\n<h2>Mowing height interacts with frequency</h2>\n<p>Lower mowing heights reduce remaining leaf area.</p>\n<p>This requires more frequent mowing to avoid excessive removal.</p>\n<p>Higher mowing heights allow longer intervals without stressing the plant.</p>\n\n<h2>Weather-driven variability</h2>\n<p>Rain accelerates growth by increasing water availability and nutrient movement.</p>\n<p>Drought and heat suppress growth regardless of mowing habits.</p>\n<p>Fixed schedules ignore these shifts and increase stress risk.</p>\n\n<h2>Consequences of mowing too often</h2>\n<p>Repeated removal of young leaf tissue limits photosynthesis.</p>\n<p>Roots shrink in response to reduced energy supply.</p>\n<p>Stress tolerance declines over time.</p>\n\n<h2>Consequences of mowing too infrequently</h2>\n<p>Overgrown grass requires heavy cuts.</p>\n<p>Large leaf-area loss shocks the plant.</p>\n<p>Scalping becomes more likely, especially on uneven ground.</p>\n\n<h2>Interpreting mowing stress signals</h2>\n<p>Delayed regrowth indicates excessive frequency or severity.</p>\n<p>Clumping and uneven color suggest infrequent mowing.</p>\n<p>These symptoms reflect energy imbalance rather than blade height alone.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Mowing frequency should track growth rate, not habit.</p>\n<p>Healthy lawns adjust mowing timing as conditions change.</p>"
