  "content_html": "<h1>Warm Season vs Cool Season Grasses Explained</h1>\n\n<h2>The core difference</h2>\n<p>Warm-season grasses are built for heat. Growth accelerates as temperatures climb and slows hard in cool weather.</p>\n<p>Cool-season grasses are built for mild temperatures. Growth surges in spring and fall, then struggles in heat.</p>\n<p>This is not a small detail. It drives the lawn\u2019s green-up timing, stress tolerance, and recovery speed.</p>\n\n<h2>Growth calendar by season</h2>\n<p>Warm-season turf tends to look best from late spring through summer. It often goes tan or dull in cool months.</p>\n<p>Cool-season turf tends to look best in spring and fall. Summer can cause thinning, off-color patches, and stalled growth.</p>\n<p>Winter behavior varies by region, but the pattern stays consistent: warm-season declines earlier, cool-season holds color longer.</p>\n\n<h2>Temperature triggers that matter</h2>\n<p>Warm-season growth ramps when soil warms up and nights stay mild. Cold snaps can stall growth fast.</p>\n<p>Cool-season growth ramps when daytime highs are moderate and soil is not overheated. Heat and warm nights drive stress.</p>\n<p>Soil temperature matters more than a single warm day. Turf responds to trends, not one afternoon.</p>\n\n<h2>How to tell what type is in the yard</h2>\n<p>Seasonal timing is the cleanest clue. Early spring green-up usually points to cool-season turf.</p>\n<p>Summer dominance with a winter fade usually points to warm-season turf. A winter lawn that stays green often indicates cool-season or overseeding.</p>\n<p>Leaf texture and runner behavior help. Many warm-season grasses spread with visible runners, while many cool-season lawns spread by bunching or fine stolons depending on species.</p>\n\n<h2>Water needs and drought behavior</h2>\n<p>Warm-season grasses generally handle heat and short dry periods better once established. They can reduce growth and ride stress.</p>\n<p>Cool-season grasses often need more consistent moisture in hot weather. Heat plus dryness can turn minor stress into decline.</p>\n<p>Overwatering is not a fix. Saturated roots and shallow rooting make both types weaker under stress.</p>\n\n<h2>Mowing differences</h2>\n<p>Warm-season turf often tolerates lower mowing when growth is strong, but scalping during spring green-up can set it back.</p>\n<p>Cool-season turf usually performs better with slightly higher mowing in summer. Taller leaf blades shade soil and reduce heat stress.</p>\n<p>Blade sharpness matters for both. Ragged cuts increase browning and slow recovery.</p>\n\n<h2>Fertilizer timing and why it backfires</h2>\n<p>Warm-season feeding aligns with active summer growth. Heavy fertilizer during cool weather tends to waste product and encourage weak growth.</p>\n<p>Cool-season feeding aligns with spring and fall growth. Heavy fertilizer right before peak heat can push tender growth that burns out.</p>\n<p>Timing matters as much as product choice. Feeding when the grass is not growing well usually creates problems, not gains.</p>\n\n<h2>Overseeding and mixed lawns</h2>\n<p>Warm-season lawns are often overseeded with cool-season grass for winter color in some regions. That creates a seasonal handoff.</p>\n<p>Mixed lawns can happen naturally from patch repairs, shade zones, or past renovations. They rarely look uniform year-round.</p>\n<p>A mixed lawn is manageable, but expectations must match reality. Uniform color across all seasons is uncommon with mixed turf types.</p>\n\n<h2>What to do with the result</h2>\n<p>Confirming the season type sets the calendar. Watering, mowing height, and feeding should follow the grass\u2019s active growth period.</p>\n<p>If the lawn looks great only part of the year, that is often normal behavior for the turf type. Chasing year-round peak color usually causes damage.</p>\n<p>When performance is consistently poor, the issue is usually shade, compaction, irrigation coverage, or soil problems, not the season category alone.</p>"
