  "content_html": "<h1>Why Grass Turns Yellow</h1>\n\n<h2>Yellowing is a loss of chlorophyll</h2>\n<p>Grass appears yellow when chlorophyll production drops.</p>\n<p>This usually happens before growth fully slows or stops.</p>\n\n<h2>Water stress in both directions</h2>\n<p>Underwatering limits nutrient movement and photosynthesis.</p>\n<p>Overwatering reduces oxygen and weakens roots.</p>\n\n<h2>Nitrogen and nutrient imbalance</h2>\n<p>Nitrogen deficiency is a common cause of pale color.</p>\n<p>Excess nutrients can also disrupt uptake and cause yellowing.</p>\n\n<h2>Soil compaction effects</h2>\n<p>Compacted soil restricts root growth.</p>\n<p>Shallow roots struggle to support healthy leaf color.</p>\n\n<h2>Seasonal growth slowdowns</h2>\n<p>Grass yellows naturally when growth conditions are poor.</p>\n<p>This often happens during heat, cold, or drought.</p>\n\n<h2>Mowing stress</h2>\n<p>Cutting too much leaf at once reduces energy production.</p>\n<p>Color loss often follows heavy or frequent scalping.</p>\n\n<h2>Pest and disease pressure</h2>\n<p>Root damage reduces nutrient flow to blades.</p>\n<p>Yellowing can appear before visible thinning.</p>\n\n<h2>What yellow color usually means</h2>\n<p>Yellow grass is stressed, not dead.</p>\n<p>Correcting the cause usually restores color over time.</p>"
