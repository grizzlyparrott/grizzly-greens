  "description": "Grass is cut too short when leaf-area loss disrupts energy production, exposes crowns, and reduces root depth beyond recovery limits.",

  "content_html": "<h1>How Short Is Too Short to Cut Grass</h1>\n\n<h2>Why cutting height affects survival</h2>\n<p>Grass relies on leaf blades to produce carbohydrates.</p>\n<p>Cutting height determines how much photosynthetic tissue remains after mowing.</p>\n<p>Too little remaining leaf area forces the plant into energy deficit.</p>\n\n<h2>The role of the crown</h2>\n<p>The crown contains the growth point and connects leaves to roots.</p>\n<p>It sits near the soil surface and is vulnerable to heat and drying.</p>\n<p>Low cutting heights expose the crown to environmental stress.</p>\n\n<h2>Leaf-area loss and carbohydrate collapse</h2>\n<p>Severe cuts remove stored energy capacity.</p>\n<p>The plant must redirect carbohydrates from roots to rebuild leaves.</p>\n<p>This weakens root systems and slows recovery.</p>\n\n<h2>Root response to low mowing</h2>\n<p>Roots adjust to available energy.</p>\n<p>Reduced leaf area leads to reduced root mass.</p>\n<p>Shallow roots increase drought and heat sensitivity.</p>\n\n<h2>Soil temperature amplification</h2>\n<p>Short grass allows more sunlight to reach soil.</p>\n<p>Soil temperatures rise, stressing roots.</p>\n<p>High root-zone temperatures reduce water uptake efficiency.</p>\n\n<h2>Water loss and evaporation</h2>\n<p>Low turf dries faster due to increased airflow.</p>\n<p>Evaporation accelerates water stress.</p>\n<p>Irrigation demand rises as cutting height drops.</p>\n\n<h2>Grass-type tolerance differences</h2>\n<p>Some grasses evolved for low cutting.</p>\n<p>Others rely on taller leaf structure for survival.</p>\n<p>Ignoring species tolerance accelerates decline.</p>\n\n<h2>Cumulative damage from repeated low cuts</h2>\n<p>Single low cuts cause stress.</p>\n<p>Repeated low cuts prevent full recovery.</p>\n<p>Thinning and bare spots develop gradually.</p>\n\n<h2>Recognizing the biological limit</h2>\n<p>Grass is cut too short when regrowth slows noticeably.</p>\n<p>Color loss and thinning indicate energy failure.</p>\n<p>The limit is defined by recovery capacity, not appearance.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Cutting too short undermines root health before visible decline.</p>\n<p>Sustainable height preserves energy balance and resilience.</p>"
