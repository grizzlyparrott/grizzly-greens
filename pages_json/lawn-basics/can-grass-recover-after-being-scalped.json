  "description": "Grass can recover after scalping if crowns remain intact and carbohydrate reserves are sufficient to rebuild lost leaf tissue.",
  "card_blurb": "Scalping is severe stress, not automatic failure. This explains when recovery is biologically possible and when damage becomes permanent.",
  "content_html": "<h1>Can Grass Recover After Being Scalped</h1>\n\n<h2>What scalping does to the plant</h2>\n<p>Scalping removes nearly all photosynthetic tissue.</p>\n<p>This forces the plant to rely entirely on stored carbohydrates.</p>\n<p>The crown becomes exposed to environmental stress.</p>\n\n<h2>Crown survival as the recovery limit</h2>\n<p>The crown contains the growth point.</p>\n<p>If the crown is intact, regrowth is possible.</p>\n<p>If the crown is damaged or desiccated, recovery cannot occur.</p>\n\n<h2>Carbohydrate reserve depletion</h2>\n<p>Regrowth after scalping consumes stored energy.</p>\n<p>Repeated scalping events exhaust reserves.</p>\n<p>Once reserves are depleted, regrowth slows or stops.</p>\n\n<h2>Root system response</h2>\n<p>Root mass shrinks following severe leaf loss.</p>\n<p>Reduced roots limit water and nutrient uptake.</p>\n<p>This feedback slows recovery further.</p>\n\n<h2>Temperature and moisture effects</h2>\n<p>Cool, moist conditions reduce respiration demand.</p>\n<p>Hot, dry conditions accelerate reserve loss.</p>\n<p>Environmental context strongly affects outcome.</p>\n\n<h2>Species-dependent recovery capacity</h2>\n<p>Some grasses evolved under grazing pressure.</p>\n<p>These species tolerate scalping better.</p>\n<p>Others decline rapidly after severe cuts.</p>\n\n<h2>Stress accumulation versus single events</h2>\n<p>One scalping event is often survivable.</p>\n<p>Repeated events compound damage.</p>\n<p>Recovery probability declines with each occurrence.</p>\n\n<h2>Distinguishing recovery from replacement</h2>\n<p>Slow regrowth indicates depleted reserves.</p>\n<p>Persistent bare crowns signal failure.</p>\n<p>Time, not appearance alone, reveals outcome.</p>\n\n<h2>Related guides</h2>\n<p>What Happens If You Cut Grass Too Short</p>\n<p>How Tall Grass Should Be Left After Mowing</p>\n<p>How Often Grass Should Be Mowed</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Grass recovery after scalping depends on crown survival and energy reserves.</p>\n<p>Understanding these limits explains why some lawns rebound while others do not.</p>"
