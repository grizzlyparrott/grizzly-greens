  "description": "Grass can recover after scalping if crowns remain intact and carbohydrate reserves are sufficient to rebuild lost photosynthetic tissue.",
  "card_blurb": "Scalping creates extreme energy stress. Recovery depends on crown survival, reserve availability, and environmental conditions.",
  "content_html": "<h1>Can Grass Recover After Being Scalped</h1>\n\n<h2>Scalping as extreme leaf removal</h2>\n<p>Scalping removes nearly all photosynthetic tissue, eliminating the plant’s ability to produce carbohydrates in the short term.</p>\n<p>Recovery depends entirely on stored energy and the integrity of the crown.</p>\n\n<h2>Crown survival as the recovery threshold</h2>\n<p>The crown contains the growth point from which new leaves emerge.</p>\n<p>If the crown remains intact and hydrated, regrowth is biologically possible.</p>\n<p>If the crown is damaged by heat, desiccation, or mechanical injury, recovery cannot occur.</p>\n\n<h2>Carbohydrate reserve depletion</h2>\n<p>Regrowing leaf tissue requires significant energy.</p>\n<p>Stored carbohydrates are consumed rapidly after scalping.</p>\n<p>Repeated scalping events exhaust reserves and slow or prevent regrowth.</p>\n\n<h2>Root system response</h2>\n<p>Severe leaf loss triggers root contraction.</p>\n<p>Reduced root mass limits water and nutrient uptake.</p>\n<p>This feedback slows recovery even under favorable conditions.</p>\n\n<h2>Environmental moderation of recovery</h2>\n<p>Cool temperatures and adequate moisture reduce respiration demand.</p>\n<p>Hot, dry conditions accelerate reserve loss and crown stress.</p>\n<p>Environmental context strongly influences outcomes.</p>\n\n<h2>Species-dependent tolerance</h2>\n<p>Some grasses evolved under grazing pressure and tolerate severe defoliation.</p>\n<p>Others lack sufficient reserve capacity and decline rapidly.</p>\n\n<h2>Distinguishing recovery from failure</h2>\n<p>Gradual regrowth indicates surviving crowns and remaining reserves.</p>\n<p>Persistent bare crowns indicate irreversible damage.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Grass recovery after scalping is possible but limited. Crown survival and energy reserves determine whether regrowth occurs or decline becomes permanent.</p>"
