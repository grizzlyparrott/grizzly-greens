  "content_html": "<h1>Does Grass Grow at Night</h1>\n\n<h2>Photosynthesis versus growth processes</h2>\n<p>Photosynthesis requires light and stops entirely after sunset. Growth, however, is the result of cell division and expansion, which do not require light directly.</p>\n<p>This distinction explains why grass can appear to grow overnight despite producing no new energy during darkness.</p>\n\n<h2>Carbohydrate use after sunset</h2>\n<p>Carbohydrates produced during daylight are stored temporarily in leaves, crowns, and roots.</p>\n<p>At night, these reserves fuel respiration, tissue maintenance, and limited growth processes.</p>\n<p>Net growth depends on whether daytime production exceeded nighttime consumption.</p>\n\n<h2>Respiration rate and temperature</h2>\n<p>Respiration occurs continuously and increases with temperature.</p>\n<p>Cool nights reduce carbohydrate loss, improving growth efficiency.</p>\n<p>Warm nights accelerate respiration and reduce net growth potential.</p>\n\n<h2>Cell expansion and water relations</h2>\n<p>Lower nighttime evaporation increases leaf water content.</p>\n<p>Higher turgor pressure allows cells to elongate, contributing to blade extension.</p>\n<p>This mechanical expansion creates the perception of night growth.</p>\n\n<h2>Seasonal influence on nighttime growth</h2>\n<p>In spring and fall, cool nights and moderate days favor efficient carbohydrate use.</p>\n<p>In summer, warm nights limit recovery and growth despite adequate daylight.</p>\n\n<h2>Limits of nighttime growth</h2>\n<p>No growth can occur if carbohydrate reserves are depleted.</p>\n<p>Extended stress during the day reduces the resources available for overnight processes.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Grass does not generate energy at night. Observed nighttime growth reflects how efficiently stored carbohydrates are used under favorable conditions.</p>"
