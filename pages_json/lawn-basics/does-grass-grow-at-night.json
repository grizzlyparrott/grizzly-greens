  "content_html": "<h1>Does Grass Grow at Night</h1>\n\n<h2>Photosynthesis versus growth</h2>\n<p>Photosynthesis requires light and stops at night.</p>\n<p>Growth, however, is the result of cell division and expansion powered by stored carbohydrates.</p>\n<p>These processes can continue without light.</p>\n\n<h2>Role of respiration after sunset</h2>\n<p>Respiration occurs continuously.</p>\n<p>At night, carbohydrates produced during the day are consumed to maintain tissue and support growth.</p>\n<p>Lower nighttime temperatures reduce respiration losses.</p>\n\n<h2>Cell expansion during cooler periods</h2>\n<p>Water availability and lower temperatures favor cell expansion.</p>\n<p>Grass blades often elongate overnight as cells absorb water.</p>\n<p>This creates the perception of night growth.</p>\n\n<h2>Carbohydrate allocation timing</h2>\n<p>Daytime photosynthesis builds reserves.</p>\n<p>Nighttime growth draws from these reserves.</p>\n<p>Net growth depends on whether daytime production exceeded nighttime consumption.</p>\n\n<h2>Temperature effects on overnight growth</h2>\n<p>Warm nights increase respiration demand.</p>\n<p>High nighttime respiration reduces carbohydrate availability for growth.</p>\n<p>Cool nights improve growth efficiency.</p>\n\n<h2>Moisture and turgor pressure</h2>\n<p>Reduced evaporation at night increases leaf water content.</p>\n<p>Higher turgor pressure supports elongation.</p>\n<p>This effect is mechanical rather than photosynthetic.</p>\n\n<h2>Why night growth varies seasonally</h2>\n<p>In spring and fall, nights are cool and growth is efficient.</p>\n<p>In summer, warm nights reduce net growth.</p>\n<p>Seasonal patterns dominate daily timing.</p>\n\n<h2>Related guides</h2>\n<p>How Fast Grass Grows by Season</p>\n<p>How Grass Actually Grows</p>\n<p>How Often Grass Should Be Mowed</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Grass does not create energy at night.</p>\n<p>Observed overnight growth reflects the use of stored carbohydrates under favorable conditions.</p>"
