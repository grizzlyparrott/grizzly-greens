  "content_html": "<h1>How Tall Grass Should Be Left After Mowing</h1>\n\n<h2>Residual height as an energy constraint</h2>\n<p>The height of grass left after mowing determines how much photosynthetic surface remains available to the plant. This remaining leaf area directly controls daily carbohydrate production, which fuels respiration, root maintenance, and new growth.</p>\n<p>Residual height therefore functions as an energy constraint. Adequate height allows the plant to maintain a positive energy balance, while insufficient height forces reliance on stored reserves.</p>\n\n<h2>Photosynthetic capacity and recovery speed</h2>\n<p>Photosynthesis scales with available leaf surface area. Taller residual height supports greater carbohydrate production per day, allowing faster recovery after mowing.</p>\n<p>Lower residual height reduces energy production and prolongs recovery, increasing the window during which the plant is vulnerable to environmental stress.</p>\n\n<h2>Root depth regulation</h2>\n<p>Root systems respond to sustained carbohydrate availability. Lawns maintained at higher residual heights develop deeper, more extensive roots over time.</p>\n<p>When residual height is consistently low, root systems contract, reducing access to water and nutrients and increasing sensitivity to drought and heat.</p>\n\n<h2>Soil temperature moderation</h2>\n<p>A taller leaf canopy shades the soil surface and reduces temperature extremes in the root zone. This moderation preserves root enzyme activity and microbial processes.</p>\n<p>Short canopies allow rapid soil heating, increasing metabolic stress and reducing water uptake efficiency.</p>\n\n<h2>Water balance implications</h2>\n<p>Residual height influences evaporation rates at the soil surface. Taller turf limits airflow and reduces moisture loss.</p>\n<p>Short turf dries more quickly, increasing frequency and severity of water stress even under identical irrigation regimes.</p>\n\n<h2>Stress tolerance margins</h2>\n<p>Grass maintained with adequate residual height has greater tolerance for heat, traffic, and mowing stress. Energy reserves are replenished more consistently.</p>\n<p>Low residual height narrows this margin, making otherwise minor stressors more damaging.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The biologically appropriate mowing height is defined by the plant’s ability to maintain positive energy balance and root integrity. Residual height is therefore a structural determinant of long-term turf resilience.</p>"
