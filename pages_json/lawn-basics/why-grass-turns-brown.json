  "content_html": "<h1>Why Grass Turns Brown</h1>\n\n<h2>Brown means growth has stopped</h2>\n<p>Brown blades no longer photosynthesize.</p>\n<p>The cause determines whether recovery is possible.</p>\n\n<h2>Drought and heat stress</h2>\n<p>Extended dryness forces grass into survival mode.</p>\n<p>Leaf tissue dries out to protect the crown.</p>\n\n<h2>Natural dormancy</h2>\n<p>Some grasses turn brown to conserve energy.</p>\n<p>Dormant grass can recover when conditions improve.</p>\n\n<h2>Root failure</h2>\n<p>Damaged or shallow roots cannot support growth.</p>\n<p>This often follows overwatering or compaction.</p>\n\n<h2>Mowing damage</h2>\n<p>Scalping exposes crowns to heat.</p>\n<p>Recovery slows or stops after repeated stress.</p>\n\n<h2>Disease and pests</h2>\n<p>Root and crown damage cut off water flow.</p>\n<p>Brown patches often expand outward over time.</p>\n\n<h2>Soil and surface heat</h2>\n<p>Hardscapes raise soil temperature.</p>\n<p>Grass near pavement browns first.</p>\n\n<h2>Brown does not always mean dead</h2>\n<p>Check crowns and roots before replacement.</p>\n<p>Many lawns rebound after stress passes.</p>"
