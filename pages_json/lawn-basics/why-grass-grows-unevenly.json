  "description": "Grass grows unevenly due to differences in soil structure, moisture, light, root competition, and microclimate conditions across a lawn.",
  "card_blurb": "Uneven growth reflects site variability, not random failure. This explains why lawns develop fast and slow zones over time.",
  "content_html": "<h1>Why Grass Grows Unevenly</h1>\n\n<h2>Uneven growth is the normal baseline</h2>\n<p>Lawns appear uniform from a distance, but the underlying environment is rarely consistent. Soil depth, texture, and compaction vary within short distances.</p>\n<p>Grass responds directly to these differences. Growth accelerates where conditions are favorable and slows where they are limiting.</p>\n<p>Uneven growth reflects environmental reality rather than poor maintenance.</p>\n\n<h2>Soil variability and root development</h2>\n<p>Roots grow deeper in loose, well-aerated soil and remain shallow in compacted zones.</p>\n<p>Deeper roots access more water and nutrients, supporting faster blade production.</p>\n<p>Shallow-rooted areas lag even when surface conditions appear similar.</p>\n\n<h2>Light distribution effects</h2>\n<p>Sun exposure drives photosynthesis directly.</p>\n<p>Areas receiving more light warm earlier and grow faster.</p>\n<p>Partial shade reduces carbohydrate production, slowing regrowth.</p>\n\n<h2>Water movement and infiltration</h2>\n<p>Water does not distribute evenly across soil.</p>\n<p>Slopes shed moisture while low spots retain it.</p>\n<p>Both extremes affect root oxygen availability and growth rate.</p>\n\n<h2>Root competition from trees and shrubs</h2>\n<p>Woody plants extract water aggressively.</p>\n<p>Grass roots near trees operate under chronic resource limitation.</p>\n<p>This results in thinner, slower-growing turf.</p>\n\n<h2>Compaction from traffic patterns</h2>\n<p>Foot traffic compresses soil along consistent paths.</p>\n<p>Compaction reduces pore space and limits root respiration.</p>\n<p>Growth slows where oxygen exchange is restricted.</p>\n\n<h2>Microclimates within a yard</h2>\n<p>Fences, buildings, and slopes alter airflow and heat retention.</p>\n<p>These microclimates change evaporation rates and soil temperature.</p>\n<p>Grass adapts locally, creating uneven growth rates.</p>\n\n<h2>Mowing amplification effects</h2>\n<p>Fast-growing areas recover quicker after mowing.</p>\n<p>Slow areas appear scalped even at the same cut height.</p>\n<p>Mowing exaggerates existing growth differences.</p>\n\n<h2>Diagnosing uneven growth</h2>\n<p>Persistent patterns usually reflect soil or light issues.</p>\n<p>Recent changes point to irrigation or compaction causes.</p>\n<p>Uniform solutions rarely correct localized constraints.</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Uneven growth is a response to uneven conditions.</p>\n<p>Understanding the limiting factor explains the pattern better than chasing uniformity.</p>"
