  <h1>Why Lawns Get Fungal Infections</h1>

  <h2>Spores are already present waiting for the right conditions</h2>
  <p>Fungal spores exist on every lawn, carried by wind, water, and equipment. They settle on grass blades and soil surfaces constantly.</p>
  <p>Infection does not happen because spores arrive. It happens when moisture, temperature, and plant stress align long enough for those spores to germinate and penetrate tissue.</p>

  <h2>Leaf wetness duration determines whether spores can infect</h2>
  <p>Fungal spores need continuous moisture to activate and breach the leaf surface. A few hours of wetness may not be enough, but extended dew, rain, or irrigation that keeps blades wet for six to twelve hours creates infection windows.</p>
  <p>The lawn does not get sick from being wet once. It gets sick from staying wet repeatedly.</p>

  <h2>Temperature narrows the window to specific seasons</h2>
  <p>Most lawn fungi thrive within particular temperature ranges. Cool-season diseases dominate spring and fall, while warm-season pathogens peak in summer.</p>
  <p>These seasonal patterns explain why the same lawn can go months without infection and then develop widespread disease within days once conditions shift into the pathogen's optimal zone.</p>

  <h2>Weak grass cannot resist spore penetration</h2>
  <p>Healthy grass produces waxy cuticles and defensive compounds that slow or block fungal entry. Stressed plants lack the resources to maintain those barriers.</p>
  <p>Once the pathogen breaches a compromised leaf, it spreads internally before any external symptom appears. The timeline for this progression matches observations in <a href="/weeds-pests/how-long-it-takes-grass-to-recover.html">How Long It Takes Grass to Recover</a>, where damage accumulates faster than repair.</p>

  <h2>Dense turf traps humidity and extends wetness periods</h2>
  <p>Thick grass canopies limit airflow at ground level. Dew and irrigation water linger in that trapped environment, staying on lower leaves long after upper growth dries.</p>
  <p>The very density that looks healthy becomes the factor that keeps conditions favorable for infection hour after hour.</p>

  <h2>Nitrogen pushes soft growth that fungi exploit easily</h2>
  <p>Heavy fertilization produces lush, fast-growing tissue with thin cell walls. This growth is more susceptible to penetration and spreads infection faster once breached.</p>
  <p>The grass looks vigorous but becomes structurally weaker, giving pathogens an easier entry point during vulnerable periods.</p>

  <h2>Evening watering leaves blades wet through the night</h2>
  <p>Irrigating late in the day ensures grass stays moist during the coolest hours when evaporation is slowest. This creates the extended wetness period most fungi require.</p>
  <p>Morning watering allows blades to dry quickly as temperatures rise, shortening the infection window before spores can complete germination.</p>

  <h2>Thatch holds moisture against crowns longer than bare soil does</h2>
  <p>A thick thatch layer acts like a sponge, trapping water near the base of the plant. Crowns and lower stems remain wet even when the soil surface has dried.</p>
  <p>This creates persistent infection sites where fungi can establish and spread upward into the canopy without ever being exposed to drying conditions.</p>

  <h2>Mowing wounds provide direct pathogen entry</h2>
  <p>Every cut creates an open wound on the grass blade. If spores land on fresh cuts while moisture is present, they bypass the plant's outer defenses entirely.</p>
  <p>Mowing during wet conditions or immediately before rain amplifies infection risk by ensuring wounded tissue stays moist long enough for spores to germinate and invade.</p>

  <h2>Circular spread patterns indicate established infection centers</h2>
  <p>Once a fungus establishes at a single point, it radiates outward as the pathogen exhausts resources in the center and moves to fresh tissue at the edges.</p>
  <p>This creates the ring formations described in <a href="/weeds-pests/why-lawn-disease-appears-in-circles.html">Why Lawn Disease Appears in Circles</a>, where the visible shape reflects how the pathogen spreads from an initial infection site.</p>

  <h2>Roots weakened by infection pull free without resistance</h2>
  <p>Fungal pathogens that attack crowns and roots destroy the anchoring structures that hold grass in place. The plant looks intact from above but has no connection to the soil.</p>
  <p>This matches the failure mode outlined in <a href="/weeds-pests/why-grass-pulls-up-easily.html">Why Grass Pulls Up Easily</a>, where the appearance of health masks complete loss of root function.</p>

  <h2>Prevention blocks infection before symptoms appear</h2>
  <p>Once visible damage shows, the fungus has already spread through hidden tissue. Treatment at that stage controls further spread but does not reverse what has been lost.</p>
  <p>This is why the approach detailed in <a href="/weeds-pests/why-prevention-works-better-than-treatment.html">Why Prevention Works Better Than Treatment</a> focuses on stopping conditions that allow infection rather than fighting established disease after the lawn has already declined.</p>
