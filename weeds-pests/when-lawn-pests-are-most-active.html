  <h1>When Lawn Pests Are Most Active</h1>

  <h2>Pest activity peaks when recovery slows</h2>
  <p>Lawn pests are always present at low levels. They become noticeable when grass cannot recover fast enough to hide the impact.</p>
  <p>Activity feels higher because damage stops being absorbed.</p>

  <h2>Warm periods compress damage into shorter windows</h2>
  <p>Heat speeds pest feeding cycles while stressing grass at the same time. Recovery windows shrink as pressure increases.</p>
  <p>This compression is why activity clusters instead of spreading evenly through the year.</p>

  <h2>Stress timing matters more than the calendar</h2>
  <p>Pests do not follow dates. They respond to conditions that favor uninterrupted feeding.</p>
  <p>Those same timing windows explain patterns seen in <a href="/weeds-pests/when-weeds-are-hardest-to-kill.html">When Weeds Are Hardest to Kill</a>, where control weakens under sustained stress.</p>

  <h2>Open ground increases pest visibility</h2>
  <p>Thin areas concentrate activity because roots and crowns are easier to access. Damage accelerates where coverage is already weak.</p>
  <p>This overlap mirrors what happens in <a href="/weeds-pests/how-bare-spots-invite-weeds.html">How Bare Spots Invite Weeds</a>, where exposure amplifies pressure.</p>

  <h2>Young lawns experience activity earlier</h2>
  <p>New turf lacks deep roots and coordinated recovery. Even light pest pressure can outpace repair.</p>
  <p>This is why timing issues align with patterns in <a href="/weeds-pests/why-new-lawns-arent-immune.html">Why New Lawns Aren’t Immune</a>, where vulnerability is built in.</p>

  <h2>Moisture swings intensify feeding cycles</h2>
  <p>Rapid shifts between wet and dry conditions stress grass repeatedly. Pests benefit when recovery keeps getting reset.</p>
  <p>Each reset creates another opening for activity to continue.</p>

  <h2>Short relief periods hide growing pressure</h2>
  <p>Cool days or rainfall can briefly mask pest impact. The lawn looks stable again.</p>
  <p>If recovery never finishes, activity resumes as soon as stress returns.</p>

  <h2>Peak activity is a symptom, not a phase</h2>
  <p>Pests appear most active when the lawn falls behind. The insects did not suddenly arrive.</p>
  <p>The lawn simply ran out of time to keep up.</p>
