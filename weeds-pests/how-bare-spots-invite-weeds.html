  <h1>How Bare Spots Invite Weeds</h1>

  <h2>Bare spots remove the lawn’s first line of defense</h2>
  <p>Healthy grass protects soil simply by occupying space. When that cover disappears, the surface becomes exposed and unstable.</p>
  <p>Nothing blocks light, moisture, or access anymore. That openness signals opportunity to fast-moving plants.</p>

  <h2>Exposure matters more than the size of the gap</h2>
  <p>Even small bare areas create disproportionate risk. The problem is not acreage, but interruption.</p>
  <p>Once continuity breaks, recovery must restart instead of continuing forward.</p>

  <h2>Weeds respond faster than grass can recover</h2>
  <p>Grass relies on steady growth cycles to reclaim ground. Bare spots interrupt those cycles.</p>
  <p>Weeds require less structure and less time. They establish before grass regains footing.</p>

  <h2>Seasonal timing amplifies the effect of bare ground</h2>
  <p>Bare spots are most dangerous during transition periods. Growth slows, but disturbance often continues.</p>
  <p>This imbalance aligns with <a href="/weeds-pests/how-seasons-affect-weed-growth.html">How Seasons Affect Weed Growth</a>, where timing favors opportunistic plants.</p>

  <h2>Pulling weeds can widen the opening</h2>
  <p>Removing weeds often disturbs soil further. The surface becomes looser and less stable.</p>
  <p>Without immediate recovery, the gap grows instead of closing. This effect mirrors <a href="/weeds-pests/can-pulling-weeds-make-them-worse.html">Can Pulling Weeds Make Them Worse</a> under repeated disruption.</p>

  <h2>Bare soil encourages repeat colonization</h2>
  <p>Once weeds establish in exposed soil, removal rarely ends the cycle. The conditions that allowed entry remain unchanged.</p>
  <p>Each cycle leaves the area weaker than before.</p>

  <h2>Weed type depends on how long exposure lasts</h2>
  <p>Short-term gaps invite fast-cycling plants. Longer exposure allows deeper-rooted weeds to take hold.</p>
  <p>This progression reflects the difference described in <a href="/weeds-pests/annual-vs-perennial-weeds-explained.html">Annual vs Perennial Weeds Explained</a>, driven by time, not chance.</p>

  <h2>Bare spots interrupt competitive pressure</h2>
  <p>Grass competes by density, not aggression. Bare ground removes that pressure entirely.</p>
  <p>Weeds face no resistance during establishment.</p>

  <h2>Edges of bare spots fail first</h2>
  <p>The boundary between grass and soil becomes unstable. Roots lose lateral support.</p>
  <p>Edges collapse inward, expanding the exposed area with each stress event.</p>

  <h2>Bare spots are invitations, not symptoms</h2>
  <p>Weeds do not create bare spots initially. Bare spots create weeds.</p>
  <p>Until coverage is restored and maintained, weeds will continue to accept the invitation.</p>
