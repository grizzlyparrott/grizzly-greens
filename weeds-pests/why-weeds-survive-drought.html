  <h1>Why Weeds Survive Drought</h1>

  <h2>Root systems determine drought survival</h2>
  <p>Weeds often survive drought because their roots extend deeper or spread wider than grass roots. This allows continued access to moisture long after surface soil dries.</p>
  <p>Grass depends heavily on upper soil moisture. When that layer dries, turf shuts down quickly.</p>

  <h2>Weeds tolerate stress better than turf</h2>
  <p>Many weeds evolved to survive harsh environments and repeated stress. Drought triggers dormancy rather than death.</p>
  <p>Grass lacks that flexibility. Stress accumulates until visible decline appears.</p>

  <h2>Growth timing favors weeds during dry periods</h2>
  <p>Weeds often establish earlier or maintain growth during brief moisture windows. They capitalize on small rainfall events.</p>
  <p>Grass requires consistent moisture for recovery. Sporadic watering favors weeds.</p>

  <h2>Drought reveals underlying water problems</h2>
  <p>Dry conditions expose irrigation flaws, compacted soil, and uneven coverage. Areas that fail during drought often struggled beforehand.</p>
  <p>When those issues cannot be corrected, decline becomes permanent. This threshold is discussed in <a href="/watering-irrigation/when-water-problems-are-permanent.html">When Water Problems Are Permanent</a>.</p>

  <h2>Post-treatment stress can worsen drought symptoms</h2>
  <p>Lawns often look worse after herbicide or fertilizer applications during drought. Treatments increase stress without improving recovery.</p>
  <p>This response confuses homeowners and delays proper correction. The pattern is explained in <a href="/weeds-pests/why-lawns-look-worse-after-treatment.html">Why Lawns Look Worse After Treatment</a>.</p>

  <h2>Weeds remain green while grass collapses</h2>
  <p>Some weeds maintain color and turgor under extreme dryness. Their physiology conserves water efficiently.</p>
  <p>Grass tissues dehydrate faster. Visual contrast increases weed dominance.</p>

  <h2>Drought conditions increase disease confusion</h2>
  <p>Stressed grass may appear slimy, discolored, or patchy after irrigation resumes. These symptoms resemble disease.</p>
  <p>Moisture rebound often triggers secondary issues. This overlap is detailed in <a href="/weeds-pests/why-diseased-grass-feels-slimy.html">Why Diseased Grass Feels Slimy</a>.</p>

  <h2>Weeds survive drought when recovery fails</h2>
  <p>Drought does not kill turf immediately. Failure occurs when recovery does not follow stress.</p>
  <p>Weeds exploit that delay. Dominance shifts while grass remains stalled.</p>
