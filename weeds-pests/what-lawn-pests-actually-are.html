  <h1>What Lawn Pests Actually Are</h1>

  <h2>Pests exploit weakness rather than creating it</h2>
  <p>Lawn pests do not arrive randomly or without cause. They appear when grass loses the ability to defend itself. Weakness always comes first. Feeding follows as a consequence.</p>
  <p>Pests respond to opportunity, not neglect.</p>

  <h2>Stress changes how pests interact with grass</h2>
  <p>Healthy grass tolerates minor feeding without visible damage. Stressed grass reacts differently.</p>
  <p>When recovery slows, even light feeding becomes destructive. Damage accumulates faster than repair.</p>

  <h2>Pest damage builds before symptoms look severe</h2>
  <p>Early feeding rarely causes obvious collapse. Grass remains in place while strength drains away.</p>
  <p>This delay makes pest activity hard to spot. By the time symptoms show, structure is already compromised. Spread accelerates afterward.</p>

  <h2>Soil conditions influence pest impact</h2>
  <p>Pests interact with soil as much as they do with grass blades. Root stability determines how much damage feeding causes.</p>
  <p>When soil structure breaks down, pests gain leverage. This effect increases after flooding events described in <a href="/watering-irrigation/how-flooding-changes-soil-structure.html">How Flooding Changes Soil Structure</a>.</p>

  <h2>Damage patterns reflect feeding location</h2>
  <p>Some pests affect surface tissue while others target roots below ground. The location matters more than the species.</p>
  <p>Surface feeding weakens photosynthesis. Root feeding disrupts anchoring and moisture access. Both reduce recovery speed.</p>

  <h2>Pests and disease often overlap</h2>
  <p>Pest damage weakens defenses that normally resist disease. Disease then spreads through already stressed tissue.</p>
  <p>This overlap explains why symptoms blur together. The distinction matters, as shown in <a href="/weeds-pests/how-to-tell-pest-damage-from-disease.html">How to Tell Pest Damage From Disease</a>.</p>

  <h2>Unchecked damage pushes lawns toward failure</h2>
  <p>As feeding continues, recovery windows disappear. Grass never fully resets between stress events.</p>
  <p>The lawn enters a declining cycle. At that point, damage may cross into the conditions described in <a href="/weeds-pests/when-lawn-damage-is-permanent.html">When Lawn Damage Is Permanent</a>.</p>

  <h2>Pest pressure accelerates spread problems</h2>
  <p>Weak grass allows damage to move outward quickly. Each affected area becomes a new starting point.</p>
  <p>This behavior mirrors the escalation seen in <a href="/weeds-pests/how-fast-lawn-disease-spreads.html">How Fast Lawn Disease Spreads</a>. Speed increases as resistance drops.</p>

  <h2>Pests are indicators, not the root cause</h2>
  <p>Lawn pests reveal where recovery has already failed. They do not create the initial imbalance.</p>
  <p>Until timing and stability are restored, pest presence will continue regardless of effort.</p>
