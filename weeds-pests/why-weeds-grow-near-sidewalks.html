  <h1>Why Weeds Grow Near Sidewalks</h1>

  <h2>Sidewalks create permanent edge stress</h2>
  <p>Sidewalks interrupt natural soil conditions and expose turf edges to constant stress. Heat, runoff, and compaction all intensify near concrete.</p>
  <p>Grass struggles to maintain density under those conditions. Weeds exploit the exposed margins.</p>

  <h2>Heat buildup weakens turf before weeds appear</h2>
  <p>Concrete absorbs solar heat during the day and releases it slowly overnight. Root zones along sidewalks experience longer thermal stress cycles.</p>
  <p>That stress reduces grass recovery speed. Weeds tolerate the imbalance better.</p>

  <h2>Soil near sidewalks is often compacted</h2>
  <p>Construction and foot traffic compress soil along sidewalks. Oxygen exchange drops and root penetration becomes limited.</p>
  <p>Grass declines quietly under compaction. Weeds adapt faster to shallow, dense soil.</p>

  <h2>Moisture patterns break down along hard edges</h2>
  <p>Water runoff from sidewalks creates uneven moisture zones. Some areas dry too fast while others briefly saturate.</p>
  <p>These swings prevent consistent turf recovery. Weeds respond faster to interruption.</p>

  <h2>Weed growth speed magnifies edge failures</h2>
  <p>Once an opening appears, weeds expand faster than grass can respond. Rapid establishment locks in control.</p>
  <p>This speed advantage is explained in <a href="/weeds-pests/why-weeds-grow-faster-than-grass.html">Why Weeds Grow Faster Than Grass</a>.</p>

  <h2>Pests often follow edge stress patterns</h2>
  <p>Stressed turf along sidewalks attracts insects that target weak plants. Feeding pressure accelerates decline.</p>
  <p>Sudden infestations often trace back to these stressed zones, as described in <a href="/weeds-pests/why-lawn-pests-appear-suddenly.html">Why Lawn Pests Appear Suddenly</a>.</p>

  <h2>Disease can establish in broken edge systems</h2>
  <p>Uneven moisture and stress increase disease risk near sidewalks. Infections rarely spread evenly from these points.</p>
  <p>Patchy patterns commonly develop under these conditions, which aligns with <a href="/weeds-pests/why-lawn-disease-appears-in-patches.html">Why Lawn Disease Appears in Patches</a>.</p>

  <h2>Edges fail because recovery never catches up</h2>
  <p>The sidewalk boundary reintroduces stress faster than grass can recover. Density never fully returns.</p>
  <p>Weeds grow near sidewalks because the edge never truly stabilizes.</p>
