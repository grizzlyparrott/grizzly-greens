  <h1>Why Lawn Disease Appears in Patches</h1>

  <h2>Soil variability creates zones where moisture lingers longer</h2>
  <p>Low spots, compacted areas, or sections with higher clay content hold water after surrounding grass dries. These wet pockets provide the extended leaf wetness pathogens need to infect.</p>
  <p>Disease establishes in these zones first, creating patches that reflect underlying soil differences rather than uniform spread.</p>

  <h2>Stress weakens grass unevenly across the lawn</h2>
  <p>Traffic patterns, shade gradients, and root competition from trees affect turf vigor in localized areas. Weakened grass cannot resist infection as effectively as healthy surrounding turf.</p>
  <p>Pathogens target these vulnerable patches, establishing infection where defenses are lowest. The relationship between weakness and susceptibility follows the principles described in <a href="/weeds-pests/what-causes-brown-patches-in-lawns.html">What Causes Brown Patches in Lawns</a>.</p>

  <h2>Spore distribution is random and uneven</h2>
  <p>Wind, water runoff, and equipment carry spores across the lawn without depositing them uniformly. Some areas receive heavy inoculum loads while others get minimal exposure.</p>
  <p>Infection develops where spore concentration and favorable conditions coincide, producing scattered patches instead of continuous damage.</p>

  <h2>Thatch depth varies and traps moisture differently</h2>
  <p>Thick thatch zones hold humidity against crowns and lower leaves longer than thin areas. This creates microclimates where infection windows extend hours beyond what the broader lawn experiences.</p>
  <p>Disease appears in patches that correspond to thatch accumulation patterns, even when the canopy looks uniform from above.</p>

  <h3>Irrigation coverage creates wet and dry zones</h3>
  <p>Sprinkler overlap, wind interference, and system design produce uneven moisture distribution. Areas receiving excess water stay wet long enough for infection, while drier zones remain protected.</p>
  <p>The patchy disease pattern mirrors irrigation inefficiencies that would otherwise go unnoticed.</p>

  <h2>Multiple patches indicate simultaneous infections at different sites</h2>
  <p>When conditions favor disease broadly, pathogens establish at numerous points across the lawn at once. Each patch represents a separate infection that will eventually expand and potentially merge.</p>
  <p>The scattered appearance reflects multiple starting points rather than spread from a single origin.</p>

  <h2>Patches expand but rarely grow evenly in all directions</h2>
  <p>Moisture gradients, soil changes, and stress patterns influence how fast disease spreads from each infection site. Some patches enlarge rapidly while others stall, creating irregular damage zones.</p>
  <p>Tracking which patches grow fastest reveals where conditions most favor the pathogen, as outlined in <a href="/weeds-pests/signs-a-lawn-problem-is-getting-worse.html">Signs a Lawn Problem Is Getting Worse</a>.</p>

  <h2>Bare ground left by patches fills with weeds immediately</h2>
  <p>Once disease kills grass in a patch, exposed soil offers no competition for incoming weed seeds. These opportunistic plants establish before the lawn can regrow.</p>
  <p>The mechanics of this takeover match those described in <a href="/weeds-pests/how-bare-spots-invite-weeds.html">How Bare Spots Invite Weeds</a>, where vacant ground becomes colonized faster than turf can recover.</p>

  <h2>Treating individual patches does not address underlying causes</h2>
  <p>Applying fungicide to visible disease stops spread in treated areas but does nothing to correct the soil, drainage, or stress factors that allowed infection to start there.</p>
  <p>Without addressing root causes, new patches appear in the same vulnerable zones as soon as conditions favor the pathogen again.</p>

  <h2>Patchy disease reveals where the lawn is structurally weakest</h2>
  <p>The distribution of patches maps the yard's hidden vulnerabilities—poor drainage, shallow soil, compaction, or traffic stress. These same zones will fail first under any future pressure, disease-related or not.</p>
  <p>Ignoring the pattern and treating only symptoms guarantees repeated failure in identical locations every season.</p>
