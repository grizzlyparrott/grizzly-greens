  <h1>Why Weeds Grow Along Edges</h1>

  <h2>Edges fail first because conditions change abruptly</h2>
  <p>Weeds cluster along edges because edges are not stable lawn environments. The border between turf and something hard, bare, or shaded changes water, heat, and root behavior.</p>
  <p>Grass struggles to maintain density at transitions. Weeds exploit the first gaps that stay open.</p>

  <h2>Hard surfaces create heat and moisture extremes</h2>
  <p>Concrete, stone, and compacted borders absorb heat and reflect it back into nearby soil. Moisture evaporates faster, and roots face repeated stress swings.</p>
  <p>These edge effects explain why sidewalks often become weed corridors. The pattern is detailed in <a href="/weeds-pests/why-weeds-grow-near-sidewalks.html">Why Weeds Grow Near Sidewalks</a>.</p>

  <h2>Compaction increases at borders even in well-kept yards</h2>
  <p>Foot traffic, mower wheels, and routine movement concentrate along edges. Soil becomes dense, oxygen drops, and grass roots shrink.</p>
  <p>Weeds tolerate shallow rooting better than turf. The advantage compounds each time the edge is disturbed.</p>

  <h2>Irrigation coverage is uneven near boundaries</h2>
  <p>Sprinkler overlap is rarely perfect at borders, and runoff often leaves edges short on water. Some edges stay dry while others pool, depending on slope and hardscape.</p>
  <p>Both extremes weaken turf. Once coverage breaks, weeds become the easiest plant to establish.</p>

  <h2>Disease patterns can start at edges and move inward</h2>
  <p>Edges often hold moisture differently and stay stressed longer, which increases disease risk. Early symptoms can be mistaken for simple weed pressure.</p>
  <p>Circular disease patterns can appear near borders when conditions favor spread. That behavior is described in <a href="/weeds-pests/why-lawn-disease-appears-in-circles.html">Why Lawn Disease Appears in Circles</a>.</p>

  <h2>Edges hide early decline because mowing makes everything look even</h2>
  <p>Mowing keeps plants the same height, so density loss can go unnoticed along borders. By the time texture changes are visible, weeds may already control the soil line.</p>
  <p>Early detection depends on noticing subtle shifts before takeover. The process is covered in <a href="/weeds-pests/how-to-identify-lawn-disease-early.html">How to Identify Lawn Disease Early</a>.</p>

  <h2>Weeds succeed when grass cannot close the border gap</h2>
  <p>Edges are a constant gap management problem. Grass must reclaim space repeatedly after stress, trimming, and traffic.</p>
  <p>Weeds grow along edges because edges keep reopening faster than turf can recover.</p>
