  <h1>Why Weeds Grow Near Driveways</h1>

  <h2>Driveways create constant stress at the lawn edge</h2>
  <p>Driveways absorb heat, reflect sunlight, and interrupt natural soil structure along their borders. Grass near these surfaces experiences stress far more frequently than interior turf.</p>
  <p>Repeated stress prevents turf from maintaining density. Weeds take advantage of the exposed space.</p>

  <h2>Soil near driveways behaves differently</h2>
  <p>Construction compacts soil near driveways and limits root depth. Water infiltration and oxygen movement both decline.</p>
  <p>These soil limitations weaken grass long before it looks unhealthy. The relationship between soil condition and decline is explained in <a href="/weeds-pests/how-soil-health-affects-lawn-problems.html">How Soil Health Affects Lawn Problems</a>.</p>

  <h2>Heat buildup shifts competition toward weeds</h2>
  <p>Concrete and asphalt store heat during the day and release it slowly at night. Root zones near driveways experience extended temperature stress.</p>
  <p>Weeds tolerate these fluctuations better than turf. The imbalance becomes visible along the edge first.</p>

  <h2>Moisture distribution is uneven near hard surfaces</h2>
  <p>Runoff patterns around driveways rarely match lawn needs. Some areas dry too quickly while others briefly flood.</p>
  <p>Grass struggles to recover under these swings. Weeds adapt faster to inconsistent moisture.</p>

  <h2>Sideways growth exploits open edge space</h2>
  <p>Many weeds spread laterally instead of vertically. Open edges allow runners and creeping stems to advance without resistance.</p>
  <p>This growth habit explains why edges widen over time, a pattern described in <a href="/weeds-pests/why-some-weeds-spread-sideways.html">Why Some Weeds Spread Sideways</a>.</p>

  <h2>Disturbance from traffic compounds the problem</h2>
  <p>Foot traffic, vehicle vibration, and edging tools disturb soil repeatedly along driveways. Each disturbance resets recovery.</p>
  <p>Grass never finishes rebuilding before the next disruption occurs.</p>

  <h2>Insects often concentrate along stressed borders</h2>
  <p>Weakened turf attracts insects that prefer stressed plants and exposed soil. Feeding pressure further reduces grass recovery.</p>
  <p>This overlap between stress and pest activity is outlined in <a href="/weeds-pests/common-lawn-insects-explained.html">Common Lawn Insects Explained</a>.</p>

  <h2>Edges reopen faster than lawns can close them</h2>
  <p>The border between driveway and lawn is a permanent recovery challenge. Stress returns faster than turf can respond.</p>
  <p>Weeds grow near driveways because those gaps never stay closed long enough for grass to dominate.</p>
