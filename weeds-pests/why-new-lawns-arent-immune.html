  <h1>Why New Lawns Aren't Immune</h1>

  <h2>Young grass has shallow roots that cannot tolerate stress</h2>
  <p>Newly germinated seedlings develop roots only inches deep during the first weeks. These shallow systems provide no buffer against drought, disease, or nutrient deficiency.</p>
  <p>Established lawns survive challenges by drawing on deep root reserves that new grass has not yet developed.</p>

  <h2>Tender tissue attracts pests preferentially</h2>
  <p>Soft, fast-growing blades are easier for insects to chew and digest. Young grass offers less resistance to feeding than mature, tougher tissue.</p>
  <p>Pests concentrate on new lawns because the energy required to consume tender growth is lower than feeding on established turf.</p>

  <h2>Disease infects young grass as readily as old</h2>
  <p>Pathogens do not distinguish between new and established plants. Spores land on any available grass and germinate when moisture conditions align.</p>
  <p>The circular spread patterns described in <a href="/weeds-pests/why-lawn-disease-appears-in-circles.html">Why Lawn Disease Appears in Circles</a> appear in new lawns just as they do in mature turf once infection begins.</p>

  <h2>Soil preparation brings buried weed seeds to the surface</h2>
  <p>Tilling, grading, and seed bed preparation expose dormant seeds that were buried too deep to germinate. These seeds activate immediately once brought into contact with light and moisture.</p>
  <p>This explains the weed flush following overseeding or renovation, as detailed in <a href="/weeds-pests/why-overseeding-can-trigger-weeds.html">Why Overseeding Can Trigger Weeds</a>.</p>

  <h2>New grass cannot yet shade out weed germination</h2>
  <p>Established lawns suppress weeds through dense canopies that block light from reaching soil. New grass stays thin and short for weeks, leaving soil exposed.</p>
  <p>The relationship between height and weed control outlined in <a href="/weeds-pests/how-mowing-height-affects-weeds.html">How Mowing Height Affects Weeds</a> shows that young, short grass provides minimal competitive advantage.</p>

  <h2>Establishment stress makes grass vulnerable to everything</h2>
  <p>Young lawns experience constant stress from developing root systems, adjusting to environmental conditions, and establishing metabolic functions. This baseline stress leaves no reserve capacity.</p>
  <p>Any additional challenge—heat, drought, disease, pests—pushes the grass beyond its tolerance immediately because it is already operating at maximum capacity.</p>

  <h2>Frequent watering creates ideal disease conditions</h2>
  <p>New grass requires constant moisture for germination and establishment. This keeps leaf surfaces wet for extended periods, providing continuous infection windows for pathogens.</p>
  <p>The lawn stays in the high-risk moisture zone far longer than established turf, which only needs intermittent watering.</p>

  <h2>No accumulated reserves means no recovery capacity</h2>
  <p>Mature grass stores energy in roots and crowns that support regrowth after damage. New grass has not yet built these reserves and cannot regenerate quickly from setbacks.</p>
  <p>Minor problems that established lawns absorb become fatal to new turf because the plant has nothing to draw on for repair.</p>

  <h2>Competition from existing vegetation continues during establishment</h2>
  <p>Adjacent mature grass, weeds from the existing seed bank, and surrounding plantings all compete with new seedlings for resources. Young grass must establish while fighting for space.</p>
  <p>This competitive pressure slows establishment and creates opportunities for weeds to claim ground before grass can dominate.</p>

  <h2>The critical window extends for months, not weeks</h2>
  <p>New lawns remain highly vulnerable until roots reach adequate depth and density develops enough to suppress weeds. This maturation process takes an entire growing season under ideal conditions.</p>
  <p>During this extended establishment period, the lawn needs more attention and faster intervention than mature turf because problems that would be minor in established grass can destroy new plantings within days, making the first season the most critical for determining whether the lawn will succeed or require replanting.</p>
