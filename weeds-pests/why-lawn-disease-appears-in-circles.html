  <h1>Why Lawn Disease Appears in Circles</h1>

  <h2>Fungi expand radially from a single infection origin</h2>
  <p>A spore lands, germinates, and colonizes the grass at that point. The fungal mycelium then grows outward in all directions at roughly equal speed, creating circular expansion.</p>
  <p>The shape is not deliberate but a natural consequence of uniform spread from a central source.</p>

  <h2>The center dies first and recovers while edges continue spreading</h2>
  <p>As the pathogen exhausts available tissue at the infection origin, grass begins regrowing in the middle. Meanwhile, the outer edge remains actively infected and continues advancing outward.</p>
  <p>This creates the classic ring appearance where green grass occupies the center, dead or dying turf forms the ring, and healthy grass surrounds the outside.</p>

  <h2>Nutrient depletion at the center forces outward movement</h2>
  <p>Some fungi consume soil nutrients as they spread through thatch and roots. Once the center is depleted, the pathogen must move to fresh areas to survive.</p>
  <p>The ring marks the boundary between exhausted soil and viable territory for continued fungal growth.</p>

  <h2>Moisture patterns influence whether rings form or merge</h2>
  <p>Consistent moisture allows even circular expansion. Irregular watering or drainage breaks the pattern, causing rings to become ovals or crescents.</p>
  <p>When multiple infection sites overlap, separate circles merge into irregular patches that obscure the original geometric origins.</p>

  <h2>Timing determines ring visibility and progression speed</h2>
  <p>Cool, wet periods favor diseases that produce distinct rings. Hot, dry weather may halt spread before circles complete, leaving arcs or incomplete patterns.</p>
  <p>Seasonal shifts in temperature and moisture drive the infection cycles that make ring formation predictable during certain months, as outlined in <a href="/weeds-pests/how-timing-affects-lawn-problems.html">How Timing Affects Lawn Problems</a>.</p>

  <h2>Not all diseases create visible rings</h2>
  <p>Only fungi that spread through soil or thatch in a radial pattern produce circles. Leaf-infecting diseases that move through water films or wind-blown spores create irregular, scattered damage instead.</p>
  <p>The presence or absence of rings helps identify which type of pathogen is active.</p>

  <h2>Ring diameter reveals how long infection has been active</h2>
  <p>Small circles indicate recent infection. Large rings show the pathogen has been spreading for weeks or longer.</p>
  <p>Measuring ring growth over days provides insight into spread rate and whether intervention is slowing expansion.</p>

  <h2>Weeds colonize dead centers faster than grass regrows</h2>
  <p>Once the pathogen moves outward and grass begins recovering in the middle, opportunistic plants establish before turf can fill the gap. The ring's center becomes a weed patch rather than restored lawn.</p>
  <p>This takeover follows patterns similar to those described in <a href="/weeds-pests/can-pulling-weeds-make-them-worse.html">Can Pulling Weeds Make Them Worse</a>, where intervention without addressing root causes amplifies the problem.</p>

  <h2>Treatment stops expansion but does not reverse the ring</h2>
  <p>Fungicides halt outward spread by suppressing active mycelium at the ring's edge. The dead grass inside remains dead, and recovery depends on regrowth from surviving tissue.</p>
  <p>This limitation reflects the recovery challenges outlined in <a href="/weeds-pests/can-lawn-disease-fix-itself.html">Can Lawn Disease Fix Itself</a>, where damage persists even after the pathogen stops advancing.</p>

  <h2>Rings return to the same locations each year</h2>
  <p>Fungal structures survive in soil and thatch through dormant periods. When conditions favor reactivation, growth resumes from the same underground network, often producing rings in identical spots.</p>
  <p>Breaking this cycle requires addressing the soil and thatch environment where the pathogen persists, not just treating visible symptoms.</p>
