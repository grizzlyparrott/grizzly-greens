  <h1>Why Weeds Survive Heat</h1>

  <h2>Heat tolerance is built into many weed species</h2>
  <p>Many weeds evolved in open, disturbed environments where heat stress was constant. Their physiology tolerates high leaf temperatures without shutting down.</p>
  <p>Grass often lacks that same tolerance.</p>

  <h2>Root depth buffers weeds from surface heat</h2>
  <p>Heat dries surface soil rapidly and raises root zone temperatures. Weeds with deeper or wider root systems access cooler, more stable moisture below.</p>
  <p>This buffer allows continued function during extreme conditions. Grass roots remain trapped in the hottest zone.</p>

  <h2>Thin turf amplifies heat damage</h2>
  <p>Heat stress increases evaporation and weakens shallow roots. When turf is thin, soil heats faster and moisture loss accelerates.</p>
  <p>Weeds exploit these openings aggressively. That takeover pattern is explained in <a href="/weeds-pests/why-weeds-take-over-thin-lawns.html">Why Weeds Take Over Thin Lawns</a>.</p>

  <h2>Growth habits reduce heat exposure</h2>
  <p>Many weeds grow low, spread outward, or angle leaves to reduce direct sun exposure. This limits tissue temperature during peak heat.</p>
  <p>Grass blades stand upright and absorb full radiation. Heat load becomes unavoidable.</p>

  <h2>Shade changes competitive balance during heat</h2>
  <p>Partial shade can protect weeds from thermal stress while still suppressing grass growth. The combination weakens turf while sparing competitors.</p>
  <p>This imbalance also increases disease risk. The relationship is detailed in <a href="/weeds-pests/how-shade-increases-disease-risk.html">How Shade Increases Disease Risk</a>.</p>

  <h2>Heat favors stress-adapted weed species</h2>
  <p>Not all weeds survive heat equally. Species with waxy leaves, deep roots, or rapid recovery dominate hot conditions.</p>
  <p>These are often the same species repeatedly seen during summer. Many are listed in <a href="/weeds-pests/most-common-lawn-weeds.html">Most Common Lawn Weeds</a>.</p>

  <h2>Grass recovery stalls while weeds persist</h2>
  <p>Heat slows turf recovery even after watering resumes. Growth remains limited until temperatures drop.</p>
  <p>Weeds continue expanding during that stall.</p>

  <h2>Weeds survive heat when recovery windows are missed</h2>
  <p>Heat alone does not eliminate turf. Failure occurs when grass cannot reclaim space after stress.</p>
  <p>Weeds survive because they never stop exploiting those delays.</p>
