  <h1>How to Prepare Lawns for Rainy Seasons</h1>

  <h2>Preparation starts with limiting saturation time</h2>
  <p>Rain damage happens when soil stays wet long enough to starve roots of oxygen, weaken turf structure, and keep traffic pressure from dispersing safely.</p>
  <p>Preparation is about time, not drama.</p>

  <h2>Stop irrigation before rain exposes hidden problems</h2>
  <p>Turn irrigation off early enough to let the lawn dry normally.</p>
  <p>Rainy weeks can hide how much water the system is still adding. Extra irrigation stretches wet periods and makes disease more likely. A clean shutoff window makes later symptoms easier to interpret.</p>

  <h2>Know how your soil handles repeated soaking</h2>
  <p>Soil texture controls whether rain infiltrates, stalls, or runs off into low spots. Clay soils often accept water slowly and hold it longer. The behavior of dense soils is explained in <a href="/watering-irrigation/how-clay-soil-handles-water.html">How Clay Soil Handles Water</a>. That holding pattern changes every decision during wet months.</p>
  <p>Sandier soils can still fail when layers are compacted.</p>

  <h2>Fix low spots before rain turns them into rot zones</h2>
  <p>Low areas concentrate water and keep roots stressed for longer periods.</p>
  <p>Those zones often look fine until heavy rain arrives. Once saturation becomes routine, turf thins and the spot expands. Correcting small dips early prevents a larger seasonal failure.</p>

  <h2>Dry patches matter even during rainy seasons</h2>
  <p>Some areas stay dry because they are not receiving water evenly.</p>
  <p>Dry islands force shallow rooting and increase stress sensitivity. Rain does not always fix coverage gaps because runoff follows the easiest path. The causes behind persistent dry zones are covered in <a href="/watering-irrigation/why-some-lawn-areas-stay-dry.html">Why Some Lawn Areas Stay Dry</a>.</p>

  <h2>Protect soil structure from compaction during wet months</h2>
  <p>Wet soil compacts easily, and compaction destroys pore space that water needs for movement and oxygen exchange.</p>
  <p>Traffic compresses wet ground and locks in slow drainage. Mowing ruts become channels that redirect runoff into repeated puddling. That damage can persist long after the rain ends.</p>

  <h2>Expect old water problems to return on schedule</h2>
  <p>Seasonal rain often triggers the same weak points every year because the underlying structure never changed.</p>
  <p>Repeated failure zones usually have a permanent cause, not a temporary explanation. That recurrence pattern is explained in <a href="/watering-irrigation/why-water-problems-reappear-each-year.html">Why Water Problems Reappear Each Year</a>. Using that expectation helps you target the real limiter instead of guessing. Preparation is easier when you stop being surprised.</p>

  <h2>Preparation is finished when behavior stays predictable</h2>
  <p>A prepared lawn shows consistent drying behavior after normal storms.</p>
  <p>Water should stop pooling in the same places. The surface should regain firmness on a reliable timeline.</p>
