  <h1>Why Drainage Gets Worse Over Time</h1>

  <h2>Drainage declines in small, repeatable steps</h2>
  <p>Most lawns do not lose drainage all at once.</p>
  <p>Each wet period leaves behind a small amount of unfinished recovery. On its own, that leftover seems harmless. Over time, those leftovers stack.</p>

  <h2>Soil loses its ability to reset fully</h2>
  <p>Healthy soil opens and closes as it wets and dries.</p>
  <p>When drying windows shorten, that cycle never completes. Pore spaces stay partially filled, which slows the next round of water movement before it even starts.</p>

  <h2>Roots respond by pulling back</h2>
  <p>Grass does not wait for visible damage before adapting.</p>
  <p>As drainage slows, roots shorten to avoid oxygen-poor zones. This makes the soil more dependent on surface structure, which is easier to damage and harder to restore.</p>

  <h2>Lingering moisture quietly crosses safe limits</h2>
  <p>There is a threshold where wetness stops being tolerable.</p>
  <p>As water remains longer after each event, the lawn spends more time beyond that line. The shift described in <a href="/watering-irrigation/how-long-grass-can-stay-wet-safely.html">How Long Grass Can Stay Wet Safely</a> explains why damage accelerates even without visible pooling.</p>

  <h2>Compaction turns slow drainage into chronic drainage</h2>
  <p>Soft soil compresses under normal use.</p>
  <p>Once compacted, water loses vertical escape routes and begins spreading sideways instead. This lateral movement is how localized problems expand into broader ones.</p>

  <h2>Seasonal recovery never fully catches up</h2>
  <p>Many lawns seem to improve temporarily during dry periods.</p>
  <p>But when moisture returns, the same weak zones react first. This cycle explains why problems fade and reappear each year, as outlined in <a href="/watering-irrigation/why-water-problems-reappear-each-year.html">Why Water Problems Reappear Each Year</a>.</p>

  <h2>Fixes work slower than damage accumulates</h2>
  <p>Drainage improves gradually, not instantly.</p>
  <p>When recovery takes longer than the gap between wet periods, progress stalls. This delay is central to <a href="/watering-irrigation/why-fixing-water-problems-takes-time.html">Why Fixing Water Problems Takes Time</a>, where expectations often outrun reality.</p>

  <h2>Weak zones begin influencing nearby soil</h2>
  <p>Water always seeks the easiest path.</p>
  <p>As compromised areas slow movement, nearby soil absorbs extra load. This is how isolated drainage issues begin spreading, a process detailed in <a href="/watering-irrigation/how-drainage-problems-spread.html">How Drainage Problems Spread</a>.</p>

  <h2>The lawn adapts downward instead of recovering upward</h2>
  <p>Grass can survive poor drainage by lowering its standards.</p>
  <p>Roots stay shallow, growth slows, and tolerance shrinks. The lawn remains alive but fragile.</p>

  <h2>Drainage rarely fails suddenly</h2>
  <p>By the time water stands or turf collapses, the decline has already run its course.</p>
  <p>Drainage gets worse because each cycle leaves less structure than the one before, until the system no longer has enough intact soil left to recover.</p>
