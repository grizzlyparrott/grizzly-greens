  <h1>Why Water Runs Off Instead of Soaking In</h1>

  <h2>Runoff begins when entry speed falls behind delivery</h2>
  <p>Soil can only accept water at a limited pace. Once that pace is exceeded, water chooses the surface path.</p>
  <p>Streams form across the lawn during irrigation.</p>

  <h2>Surface sealing blocks quick intake</h2>
  <p>Crusting and compression create a thin barrier at the top. Water hits that barrier and spreads outward.</p>
  <p>Water beads and travels instead of disappearing.</p>

  <h2>Soil condition controls how water behaves</h2>
  <p>Healthy soil takes in water more evenly and holds its structure during wetting. Degraded soil turns irrigation into surface movement.</p>
  <p>This connects to <a href="/watering-irrigation/how-watering-interacts-with-soil-health.html">How Watering Interacts With Soil Health</a>, where repeated wetting changes the ground.</p>

  <h2>Runoff and long wetness are the same failure in different directions</h2>
  <p>Some lawns shed water across the top while others trap it near the surface. Both come from poor movement through the soil profile.</p>
  <p>This aligns with <a href="/watering-irrigation/why-lawns-stay-wet-too-long.html">Why Lawns Stay Wet Too Long</a>, where exit slows instead of spreads.</p>

  <h2>Uneven intake creates uneven coverage</h2>
  <p>When water runs off, some areas get flooded while others stay dry. The lawn begins reacting in patches.</p>
  <p>Color shifts appear along the runoff route.</p>

  <h2>Timing controls whether water meets open soil or closed soil</h2>
  <p>Drying conditions and soil moisture history change how receptive the surface is. The same run time can either soak or slide depending on timing.</p>
  <p>This follows <a href="/watering-irrigation/how-irrigation-timing-affects-results.html">How Irrigation Timing Affects Results</a>, where conditions decide intake.</p>

  <h2>Excess surface flow damages the soil further</h2>
  <p>Moving water cuts channels and displaces fine material. That makes the surface even less receptive the next time.</p>
  <p>Small ruts or washed-out lines appear.</p>

  <h2>Roots get deprived while water is present</h2>
  <p>Runoff carries water away before it reaches the root zone. Grass experiences drought stress despite active irrigation.</p>
  <p>Leaf tips dry while the ground still looks wet.</p>

  <h2>Improvement takes longer than expected</h2>
  <p>Once runoff becomes the default behavior, changing schedules does not instantly restore intake. Soil needs time to reopen and stabilize.</p>
  <p>This mirrors <a href="/watering-irrigation/why-fixing-water-problems-takes-time.html">Why Fixing Water Problems Takes Time</a>, where lag is unavoidable.</p>

  <h2>Runoff leaves visible proof</h2>
  <p>Flow lines, puddles at edges, and dry zones beside wet zones show that water is not entering evenly. The lawn displays the path water took.</p>
  <p>Water collects at the low end instead of disappearing where it lands.</p>
