  <h1>How Often Lawns Should Be Watered</h1>

  <h2>Frequency matters more than volume</h2>
  <p>Most watering damage comes from how often water is applied rather than how much. When the soil is rewatered before it can recover, stress begins to build immediately.</p>
  <p>The ground still feels damp when the system runs again.</p>

  <h2>Grass roots depend on dry intervals</h2>
  <p>Roots need time without saturation to function normally. Constant moisture blocks that reset.</p>
  <p>You see shallow roots near the surface.</p>

  <h2>Surface dryness is misleading</h2>
  <p>Topsoil can dry while deeper layers stay wet. Watering based on appearance repeats saturation.</p>
  <p>The lawn looks dry but feels soft underfoot.</p>

  <h2>Soil movement changes drainage timing</h2>
  <p>Settling and compaction alter how quickly water exits the root zone.</p>
  <p>This follows <a href="/watering-irrigation/how-soil-settling-affects-drainage.html">How Soil Settling Affects Drainage</a>, where structure controls release.</p>

  <h2>Climate controls evaporation windows</h2>
  <p>Heat, wind, and humidity change how fast moisture leaves soil and blades.</p>
  <p>This mirrors <a href="/watering-irrigation/how-climate-affects-lawn-watering.html">How Climate Affects Lawn Watering</a>, where conditions reset timing.</p>

  <h2>Fixed schedules ignore recovery</h2>
  <p>Calendar-based watering overrides what the soil is doing. Stress accumulates quietly.</p>
  <p>You water even though the lawn still feels cool and damp.</p>

  <h2>Overlapping cycles flatten root depth</h2>
  <p>Frequent watering trains roots to stay shallow. Deeper layers stop developing.</p>
  <p>The grass pulls up easily when disturbed.</p>

  <h2>The irreversible boundary is root suffocation</h2>
  <p>Once oxygen is displaced repeatedly, roots decline faster than they can regrow.</p>
  <p>The lawn turns dull and loses spring.</p>

  <h2>After the boundary, spacing waterings does not reverse loss</h2>
  <p>Reducing frequency cannot restore roots that already failed. Weakness persists.</p>
  <p>Dry spots appear even with regular watering.</p>

  <h2>Correct frequency leaves visible balance</h2>
  <p>Firm soil, even color, and steady growth show when watering matches recovery. The lawn feels stable.</p>
  <p>You no longer see footprints linger after walking.</p>
