  <h1>How Sun Exposure Changes Water Demand</h1>

  <h2>Sunlight accelerates moisture loss immediately</h2>
  <p>Direct sun delivers energy straight to the soil and leaf surface.</p>
  <p>That energy drives evaporation and transpiration at the same time, pulling water out of the system faster than most people expect. Lawns in full sun begin losing usable moisture within hours, not days.</p>

  <h2>Water demand rises before stress is visible</h2>
  <p>Grass does not show distress the moment moisture drops.</p>
  <p>Roots continue pulling water as demand increases, masking early strain. By the time color fades or blades wilt, the system has already been operating near its limit.</p>

  <h2>Recovery happens faster in sun when moisture is available</h2>
  <p>Sunlight does not only increase demand.</p>
  <p>It also speeds metabolic activity and regrowth once water returns. Lawns in full sun often rebound more quickly than shaded turf, provided recovery is not delayed.</p>

  <h2>Uneven delivery becomes more damaging under high exposure</h2>
  <p>Sun amplifies small inconsistencies.</p>
  <p>Areas that receive less water fall behind rapidly, while adjacent sections may appear fine. This effect worsens when flow or coverage is compromised, as described in <a href="/watering-irrigation/how-clogged-systems-affect-lawns.html">How Clogged Systems Affect Lawns</a>.</p>

  <h2>Stress from sun draws secondary problems</h2>
  <p>Weakened grass sends signals.</p>
  <p>Under sustained sun stress, roots shrink and tissue thins, making the lawn more attractive to pests that exploit weakened plants. That chain reaction mirrors patterns discussed in <a href="/watering-irrigation/how-water-stress-attracts-pests.html">How Water Stress Attracts Pests</a>.</p>

  <h2>Heavy rain interacts differently with sun-exposed lawns</h2>
  <p>After dry, sun-baked conditions, soil often resists water.</p>
  <p>Instead of soaking in evenly, rain can run off or pool, creating shock rather than relief. These outcomes align with what happens in <a href="/watering-irrigation/why-heavy-rain-damages-lawns.html">Why Heavy Rain Damages Lawns</a>.</p>

  <h2>Slope intensifies solar demand</h2>
  <p>Sun exposure and gravity work together.</p>
  <p>On sloped ground, water leaves faster and returns unevenly, shortening the usable window even further. This compounds the challenges addressed in <a href="/watering-irrigation/how-to-water-sloped-lawns-properly.html">How to Water Sloped Lawns Properly</a>.</p>

  <h2>Surface dryness does not reflect root conditions</h2>
  <p>In full sun, the surface dries first.</p>
  <p>Roots may still be accessing deeper moisture even as the top layer looks depleted, making visual judgment unreliable.</p>

  <h2>Sun exposure narrows the margin for error</h2>
  <p>Timing matters more than volume.</p>
  <p>When water arrives too late, stress compounds quickly. When it arrives at the right moment, recovery is efficient and complete.</p>

  <h2>Higher demand does not mean constant watering</h2>
  <p>Sun increases the rate of use, not the need for saturation.</p>
  <p>The goal is to match timing to demand so the lawn can cycle stress and recovery instead of remaining in a constant deficit.</p>
