  <h1>How to Spot Irrigation Coverage Gaps</h1>

  <h2>Coverage gaps are overlap failures, not “dry soil”</h2>
  <p>Most sprinkler patterns are designed to work through overlap, meaning each head is expected to contribute part of the final dose while neighboring heads fill in the rest. A coverage gap forms when that overlap does not happen, so the area receives a partial dose every time the zone runs even though the system looks active and the yard sounds like it is being watered.</p>
  <p>The gap is not random, and it usually repeats in the same shape because it is caused by fixed hardware and fixed spacing.</p>

  <h2>Stress appears first where the lawn has the least margin</h2>
  <p>Coverage gaps rarely announce themselves immediately because grass can coast on stored moisture and shallow surface wetness for a short period.</p>
  <p>The weakness shows up when demand rises and the root zone needs a full recharge to stay stable, which is why new lawns often reveal gaps quickly since they operate with a smaller buffer, similar to the vulnerability described in <a href="/watering-irrigation/how-long-new-grass-needs-extra-water.html">How Long New Grass Needs Extra Water</a>.</p>

  <h2>Visible contrast after watering is an important clue</h2>
  <p>When watering ends, some sections darken evenly while others stay lighter or shift back toward dry appearance sooner.</p>
  <p>If the same areas repeatedly fail to hold that post-watering darkening, it often means the surface is getting misted but the dose is not building depth, which turns the “wet look” into a false signal.</p>

  <h2>Recurring patterns point to distribution, not weather</h2>
  <p>If a lawn struggles in the same spots across different weeks and different seasons, the system is leaving those sections behind on a regular schedule.</p>
  <p>This is one reason water problems feel seasonal or cyclical even when the homeowner changes run times, which fits the repeat behavior described in <a href="/watering-irrigation/why-water-problems-reappear-each-year.html">Why Water Problems Reappear Each Year</a>.</p>

  <h2>Run time changes can make gaps easier to notice</h2>
  <p>When run times increase, well-covered areas often look overly wet while under-covered areas still look stressed.</p>
  <p>That split is a hallmark of a coverage gap because the system is applying extra water everywhere, but only the properly overlapped zones receive the full benefit while the gap remains under-dosed.</p>

  <h2>Soil feel can be misleading in gap zones</h2>
  <p>Many coverage gaps still get enough water to soften the top layer.</p>
  <p>That can trick you into thinking water is reaching roots when it is only wetting the surface, which is why correct diagnosis depends on separating surface wetness from root-zone support, as explained in <a href="/watering-irrigation/how-to-diagnose-water-issues-correctly.html">How to Diagnose Water Issues Correctly</a>.</p>

  <h2>Edges and corners are common failure points</h2>
  <p>Perimeters often depend on a single head’s reach or a partial arc.</p>
  <p>When that head underperforms, or when wind and pressure changes shorten its throw, the outer band becomes a chronic low-dose strip even though the rest of the zone looks fine.</p>

  <h2>Small mechanical differences create large lawn differences</h2>
  <p>A nozzle that is slightly misaligned, a head that does not rise fully, or a pressure loss that reduces throw distance can remove overlap without making the sprinkler look obviously broken.</p>
  <p>The lawn responds as if it is being watered unevenly because it is, and the gap becomes more visible over time as roots retreat from the under-supported area.</p>

  <h2>Coverage gaps turn watering into a long-term imbalance</h2>
  <p>When the same area receives a partial dose for weeks, it develops shallower roots and a faster stress cycle than the rest of the yard.</p>
  <p>That difference makes future recovery harder because the gap zone becomes the first place to fail and the last place to rebound, even if everything else looks healthy.</p>
