  <h1>How Water Pressure Affects Irrigation</h1>

  <h2>Pressure determines how water leaves the system</h2>
  <p>Irrigation heads are built to operate within a narrow pressure range. When pressure falls outside that range, water does not exit in the intended pattern, even though the system still turns on and appears to be working.</p>
  <p>The lawn responds to what actually lands on the ground, not what the controller schedule promises.</p>

  <h2>Low pressure shortens reach and breaks overlap</h2>
  <p>When pressure is too low, sprinkler heads throw water a shorter distance and lose spray uniformity. Overlap disappears, leaving areas that receive only part of the intended dose during every cycle.</p>
  <p>Those zones dry faster and never build the same root support as the rest of the lawn.</p>

  <h2>High pressure creates mist and uneven delivery</h2>
  <p>Excess pressure forces water out too aggressively.</p>
  <p>Droplets become finer, drift increases, and more water evaporates or blows off target before soaking in. The lawn may look heavily watered while the soil receives less usable moisture than expected.</p>

  <h2>Pressure problems often mimic drainage issues</h2>
  <p>Uneven pressure can make some areas look dry and others stay wet even when soil conditions are consistent.</p>
  <p>This confusion is why pressure-related symptoms are often mistaken for drainage failure, delaying the kind of evaluation described in <a href="/watering-irrigation/when-a-lawn-needs-drainage-help.html">When a Lawn Needs Drainage Help</a>.</p>

  <h2>Inconsistent pressure creates repeating wet zones</h2>
  <p>When certain heads receive higher pressure than others, those areas take on more water than the soil can clear.</p>
  <p>Moisture lingers in the same locations after every cycle, producing the persistent patterns explained in <a href="/watering-irrigation/why-some-lawn-areas-stay-wet.html">Why Some Lawn Areas Stay Wet</a>.</p>

  <h2>Soil response magnifies pressure imbalance</h2>
  <p>Soil does not average out uneven application.</p>
  <p>Areas receiving excess water compact and lose oxygen faster, while under-watered areas dry out and weaken roots. Over time, pressure differences turn into structural differences in how the lawn behaves.</p>

  <h2>Pressure affects timing effectiveness</h2>
  <p>Changing run times cannot fix pressure problems.</p>
  <p>Longer runtimes exaggerate wet spots when pressure is high and still fail to supply dry zones when pressure is low. The system becomes less predictable with every adjustment.</p>

  <h2>Visual inspection can be misleading</h2>
  <p>All heads may pop up and spray, giving the impression that pressure is fine.</p>
  <p>Subtle changes in throw distance, droplet size, and spray shape are easy to miss but matter far more than whether water is visibly coming out.</p>

  <h2>Pressure issues compound over time</h2>
  <p>Because irrigation runs repeatedly, pressure imbalance trains the lawn into uneven development.</p>
  <p>Root systems adapt to what they receive, locking in weak and over-saturated zones that become harder to correct later.</p>

  <h2>Pressure controls consistency, not just flow</h2>
  <p>Water pressure sets the foundation for how evenly irrigation supports the lawn.</p>
  <p>When pressure is wrong, the system delivers water unpredictably, and no schedule change can restore balance until that underlying constraint is addressed.</p>
