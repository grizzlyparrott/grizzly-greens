  <h1>How Compacted Soil Affects Drainage</h1>

  <h2>Compaction turns soil into a closed surface</h2>
  <p>Drainage depends on open space between soil particles. Compaction crushes that space and forces water to sit where it should move.</p>
  <p>Water remains on top longer than expected.</p>

  <h2>Absorption slows before puddles form</h2>
  <p>Early compaction shows as delayed soaking rather than obvious pooling. Water starts spreading sideways to find a path.</p>
  <p>Runoff appears along edges during irrigation.</p>

  <h2>Light rain can make compaction feel worse</h2>
  <p>Small frequent rain events keep the surface damp without flushing deeper. The top layer stays sealed and slick.</p>
  <p>This connects to <a href="/watering-irrigation/why-light-frequent-rain-can-be-worse.html">Why Light Frequent Rain Can Be Worse</a>, where shallow wetness dominates.</p>

  <h2>Roots struggle even with plenty of water</h2>
  <p>When soil stays tight, roots lose access to oxygen. Moisture becomes a problem instead of a benefit.</p>
  <p>Grass feels weak and tears more easily.</p>

  <h2>New lawns get trapped in the top layer</h2>
  <p>Young roots sit near the surface and depend on that zone staying functional. Compaction removes the margin new turf needs.</p>
  <p>This aligns with <a href="/watering-irrigation/how-to-water-new-lawns-properly.html">How to Water New Lawns Properly</a>, where early conditions decide development.</p>

  <h2>Standing water becomes a repeating event</h2>
  <p>Once compaction blocks downward movement, pooling returns in the same locations. Those spots become a permanent stress zone.</p>
  <p>This mirrors <a href="/watering-irrigation/why-standing-water-kills-grass.html">Why Standing Water Kills Grass</a>, where wetness becomes lethal.</p>

  <h2>Compaction makes watering look like the cause</h2>
  <p>Watering routines get blamed because the symptoms show up right after irrigation. The real issue is that soil no longer accepts water normally.</p>
  <p>This follows <a href="/watering-irrigation/when-watering-is-not-the-real-problem.html">When Watering Is Not the Real Problem</a>, where cause sits below the schedule.</p>

  <h2>Traffic locks the pattern in place</h2>
  <p>Foot paths and mower routes compress the same zones repeatedly. Drainage declines along those lines first.</p>
  <p>Tracks stay visible after mowing.</p>

  <h2>Moisture becomes uneven across short distances</h2>
  <p>Water finds the few remaining channels and bypasses the rest. Dry and wet zones form side by side.</p>
  <p>Color becomes patchy without a clear sprinkler pattern.</p>

  <h2>Compaction leaves obvious physical signals</h2>
  <p>Slow soaking, slick surface feel, and repeat puddling point to tight soil. The lawn reacts the same way after every water event.</p>
  <p>Footing feels hard in dry weather and slippery after watering.</p>
