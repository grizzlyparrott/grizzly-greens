  <h1>How Drought Changes Soil Behavior</h1>

  <h2>Dry soil stops acting like soil</h2>
  <p>Healthy soil shifts between holding water and releasing air.</p>
  <p>During drought, that balance breaks. Particles bind together, pores collapse, and the soil behaves more like a solid mass than a flexible system.</p>

  <h2>Water resistance increases after prolonged dryness</h2>
  <p>When dry soil finally gets wet again, it does not respond evenly.</p>
  <p>Water often beads, runs sideways, or pools instead of soaking down. This delayed response is one reason lawns struggle long after drought officially ends.</p>

  <h2>Air exchange becomes unstable</h2>
  <p>Drought does not just remove moisture.</p>
  <p>It also alters how air moves through the soil. Once pore structure collapses, oxygen flow becomes inconsistent, creating stress even when moisture briefly returns.</p>

  <h2>Roots retreat before growth stops</h2>
  <p>Grass reacts early to drying conditions.</p>
  <p>Roots shorten and pull upward to survive, reducing the soil’s internal channels. That retreat makes recovery slower and ties directly into the long-term patterns described in <a href="/watering-irrigation/why-drainage-gets-worse-over-time.html">Why Drainage Gets Worse Over Time</a>.</p>

  <h2>Surface cracks misrepresent deeper damage</h2>
  <p>Visible cracking is only part of the story.</p>
  <p>Below the surface, soil layers compress and separate unevenly. Even when cracks close after rain, internal structure often does not fully return.</p>

  <h2>Drought conditions train shallow recovery</h2>
  <p>When water becomes scarce, grass adapts by surviving where moisture appears first.</p>
  <p>This reinforces shallow root systems that are less stable and more dependent on frequent moisture, the opposite of what long-term recovery needs.</p>

  <h2>Rewetting creates uneven load zones</h2>
  <p>Dry soil does not rehydrate uniformly.</p>
  <p>Some sections absorb water quickly while others resist it, forcing moisture to move sideways and concentrate stress in limited areas.</p>

  <h2>Soil behavior shifts faster than grass appearance</h2>
  <p>Grass can remain green while soil function declines.</p>
  <p>This lag hides damage until recovery fails under normal watering or rainfall.</p>

  <h2>Depth becomes harder to restore after drought</h2>
  <p>Once roots retreat and structure collapses, rebuilding depth takes time.</p>
  <p>This is why strategies discussed in <a href="/watering-irrigation/how-to-encourage-deeper-roots.html">How to Encourage Deeper Roots</a> become less effective if drought damage is ignored.</p>

  <h2>Drought changes what “normal” soil response looks like</h2>
  <p>After extended dryness, soil no longer responds the same way to water.</p>
  <p>Movement slows, recovery stretches out, and stress thresholds drop. The lawn may survive, but the soil underneath behaves differently long after rain returns.</p>
