  <h1>Why Overwatering Causes Disease</h1>

  <h2>Excess water weakens roots before disease appears</h2>
  <p>Grass does not get sick simply because leaves are wet.</p>
  <p>The real damage starts underground, where constant moisture cuts off oxygen and forces roots into survival mode. Weak roots cannot defend the plant the way healthy ones can.</p>

  <h2>Saturated soil never fully resets</h2>
  <p>Healthy soil cycles between wet and dry.</p>
  <p>Overwatering interrupts that cycle, leaving pore spaces filled and air exchange incomplete. Each new watering adds stress instead of relief.</p>

  <h2>Pathogens exploit stressed systems</h2>
  <p>Disease organisms are often already present.</p>
  <p>They become active when the lawn loses resilience. Overwatering creates the exact conditions they need by keeping roots compromised for extended periods.</p>

  <h2>Runoff can coexist with overwatering</h2>
  <p>Water flowing away does not mean soil is dry.</p>
  <p>In many cases, the surface sheds excess while the root zone stays overloaded, a mismatch explained in <a href="/watering-irrigation/why-water-runs-off-instead-of-soaking-in.html">Why Water Runs Off Instead of Soaking In</a>.</p>

  <h2>Shade extends the damage window</h2>
  <p>Shaded areas dry much more slowly.</p>
  <p>When watering schedules ignore that difference, wetness lingers and disease pressure rises, especially in patterns tied to <a href="/watering-irrigation/how-shade-affects-water-needs.html">How Shade Affects Water Needs</a>.</p>

  <h2>Uneven watering creates hidden hotspots</h2>
  <p>Not all parts of a lawn receive the same amount of water.</p>
  <p>Some zones stay wetter longer than others, quietly becoming disease centers. This imbalance reflects the risks described in <a href="/watering-irrigation/how-even-water-distribution-matters.html">How Even Water Distribution Matters</a>.</p>

  <h2>Leaf wetness is a secondary factor</h2>
  <p>Wet blades alone do not cause disease.</p>
  <p>They matter only when root stress has already lowered resistance. Without that stress, moisture on leaves usually dries without consequence.</p>

  <h2>Repeated overwatering compounds vulnerability</h2>
  <p>One heavy cycle rarely triggers disease.</p>
  <p>Problems emerge when overwatering becomes routine and recovery time disappears. Each cycle leaves the lawn less prepared for the next.</p>

  <h2>Disease often appears after watering changes</h2>
  <p>Symptoms frequently show up days later.</p>
  <p>This delay makes overwatering easy to miss as the true cause, especially when conditions seemed calm at the time.</p>

  <h2>Overwatering creates the environment disease needs</h2>
  <p>Water itself is not the enemy.</p>
  <p>Constant saturation removes oxygen, weakens roots, and slows recovery. Disease fills the gap left behind when the lawn can no longer protect itself.</p>
