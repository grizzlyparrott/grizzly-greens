  <h1>Why Some Lawn Areas Stay Dry</h1>

  <h2>Water does not land evenly across the lawn</h2>
  <p>Irrigation systems apply patterns, not guarantees. Heads throw water in arcs that overlap imperfectly, and small spacing or pressure differences can leave gaps that never receive the same amount of moisture as the rest of the yard.</p>
  <p>Those gaps dry first even when the schedule looks generous.</p>

  <h2>Dry spots often reflect shallow moisture, not no moisture</h2>
  <p>Many areas that look dry are receiving water, just not enough depth to support roots for long. Moisture wets the surface briefly, evaporates, and leaves the root zone unchanged.</p>
  <p>This is why increasing frequency without depth rarely fixes the problem, a pattern tied to the mechanics behind <a href="/watering-irrigation/why-deep-watering-works-better.html">Why Deep Watering Works Better</a>.</p>

  <h2>Roots concentrate where water is reliable</h2>
  <p>Grass adapts to inconsistency by shifting growth toward dependable moisture. Over time, roots become dense in well-watered zones and sparse elsewhere, which makes dry areas dry even faster after each cycle.</p>
  <p>The lawn slowly divides into strong and weak sections that no longer respond the same way.</p>

  <h2>Different delivery methods create different dry patterns</h2>
  <p>Sprinklers spread water across the surface while drip systems focus delivery at fixed points. Each method leaves its own signature of dry and wet areas depending on spacing, timing, and soil response.</p>
  <p>Understanding those differences helps explain why switching systems changes which areas struggle, as outlined in <a href="/watering-irrigation/difference-between-sprinklers-and-drip-system.html">Difference Between Sprinklers and Drip Systems</a>.</p>

  <h2>Soil structure redirects water away from some zones</h2>
  <p>Compacted layers, buried debris, or changes in soil texture can cause water to move sideways instead of down. When that happens, certain areas shed moisture quickly even though nearby turf stays wet.</p>
  <p>The surface looks uniform, but subsurface movement tells a different story.</p>

  <h2>Sun and exposure accelerate loss in specific locations</h2>
  <p>Edges near pavement, slopes, and open areas lose moisture faster due to heat and airflow. Even with equal watering, those spots reach stress sooner because water leaves the system more quickly.</p>
  <p>The problem is not volume but retention time.</p>

  <h2>Dry areas are not always a watering problem</h2>
  <p>When increasing water does nothing but worsen other areas, the issue is often structural rather than schedule-based. The lawn may be signaling a limit that water alone cannot overcome.</p>
  <p>This is the situation described in <a href="/watering-irrigation/when-watering-is-not-the-real-problem.html">When Watering Is Not the Real Problem</a>, where dry symptoms point to deeper constraints.</p>

  <h2>Contrast grows sharper over time</h2>
  <p>As uneven support continues, dry areas thin while wetter zones grow denser. That contrast makes the problem look sudden even though it developed gradually.</p>
  <p>By the time it is obvious, the lawn is already operating as multiple systems instead of one.</p>

  <h2>Dry spots are signals, not failures</h2>
  <p>Persistent dry areas show where water delivery, soil behavior, and root development no longer align.</p>
  <p>They mark the boundaries of what the current setup can support.</p>
