  <h1>How Clay Soil Handles Water</h1>

  <h2>Clay acts like a slow gate</h2>
  <p>Clay accepts water reluctantly and then holds it tightly once it enters. The same amount of water behaves completely differently than it does in looser soil.</p>
  <p>Pooling forms while sprinklers are still running.</p>

  <h2>Absorption happens in bursts, not smoothly</h2>
  <p>Clay often resists at first, then suddenly takes in water once the surface finally opens. That uneven intake creates patches of over-wet and under-wet ground.</p>
  <p>Dark spots appear next to dry-looking spots.</p>

  <h2>Water spreads sideways before it goes down</h2>
  <p>Because downward movement is slow, moisture tends to travel across the surface layer. This creates runoff and wasted coverage even when total water seems high.</p>
  <p>Water collects near edges and low points.</p>

  <h2>Long wet periods become normal</h2>
  <p>Once clay becomes saturated, it releases moisture slowly. Wetness persists long after watering ends.</p>
  <p>This connects to <a href="/watering-irrigation/how-long-grass-can-stay-wet-safely.html">How Long Grass Can Stay Wet Safely</a>, where duration drives problems.</p>

  <h2>Soil air space disappears quickly</h2>
  <p>Clay can lose oxygen access when moisture stays high. Roots begin to struggle even while water is present.</p>
  <p>Grass feels soft and weak under light pressure.</p>

  <h2>Surface drying can hide deeper saturation</h2>
  <p>The top layer may look dry while deeper clay still holds water. Watering based on appearance stacks wetness below.</p>
  <p>The lawn looks dry but feels spongy underfoot.</p>

  <h2>Rain changes clay behavior more than watering does</h2>
  <p>Natural rainfall often arrives with different intensity and spacing than irrigation. Clay responds strongly to those patterns.</p>
  <p>This aligns with <a href="/watering-irrigation/how-rainfall-patterns-affect-lawns.html">How Rainfall Patterns Affect Lawns</a>, where timing reshapes outcomes.</p>

  <h2>Compaction becomes easier under moisture</h2>
  <p>Wet clay compresses under traffic and equipment. Each compression reduces drainage and increases future wetness.</p>
  <p>Footprints linger longer after walking.</p>

  <h2>Drainage problems appear as repeating spots</h2>
  <p>Clay-driven wet zones tend to return in the same areas because the soil behavior is consistent. The pattern rarely moves without a structural change.</p>
  <p>The same patches stay darker after every watering.</p>

  <h2>Clay leaves obvious physical cues</h2>
  <p>Pooling, slow drying, and soft footing show how clay manages water. The lawn feels heavy even when growth looks normal.</p>
  <p>Mower tracks remain visible instead of bouncing back.</p>
