  <h1>Why New Construction Lawns Drain Poorly</h1>

  <h2>Construction disrupts soil long before grass is installed</h2>
  <p>Heavy equipment moves repeatedly across the lot during construction. Soil is compressed, scraped, and re-layered without regard for structure.</p>
  <p>By the time grass goes down, the soil is already damaged. Drainage problems are baked in from the start.</p>

  <h2>Topsoil is often removed or buried</h2>
  <p>In many builds, original topsoil is stripped away or pushed aside.</p>
  <p>Fill dirt replaces it, and that material lacks organic structure. Water moves through it unpredictably.</p>

  <h2>Compaction blocks natural water movement</h2>
  <p>Compacted soil closes pore spaces that normally allow water to move downward.</p>
  <p>Instead of infiltrating, water spreads sideways or pools at the surface.</p>
  <p>This is why new lawns can stay wet even with modest watering.</p>

  <h2>Soil layers no longer match naturally</h2>
  <p>Construction often leaves abrupt transitions between soil types.</p>
  <p>Water slows or stops when it hits those boundaries.</p>
  <p>This layered resistance affects drainage in ways homeowners don’t expect.</p>

  <h2>Drought makes construction damage harder to undo</h2>
  <p>Dry periods lock compacted soil into place.</p>
  <p>Hard layers resist root penetration and water entry.</p>
  <p>Once drought reinforces that structure, drainage problems become more persistent, which mirrors the behavior described in <a href="/watering-irrigation/how-drought-changes-soil-behavior.html">How Drought Changes Soil Behavior</a>.</p>

  <h2>Soil type determines how bad the problem becomes</h2>
  <p>Clay-heavy fill drains slowly even when undisturbed.</p>
  <p>Sandy fill drains faster but collapses more easily under equipment.</p>
  <p>Understanding the material matters because drainage depends on soil behavior, as explained in <a href="/watering-irrigation/how-soil-type-affects-watering.html">How Soil Type Affects Watering</a>.</p>

  <h2>Slopes exaggerate drainage failures</h2>
  <p>On sloped lots, compacted soil sheds water instead of absorbing it.</p>
  <p>Runoff increases while infiltration drops.</p>
  <p>Watering has to be adjusted carefully to avoid erosion and pooling, which is why slope-specific strategies matter in <a href="/watering-irrigation/how-to-water-sloped-lawns-properly.html">How to Water Sloped Lawns Properly</a>.</p>

  <h2>Settling changes drainage after installation</h2>
  <p>New soil continues to settle for months or years.</p>
  <p>As it compresses, drainage paths shift.</p>
  <p>Areas that once drained may begin holding water, a process explained further in <a href="/watering-irrigation/how-soil-settling-affects-drainage.html">How Soil Settling Affects Drainage</a>.</p>

  <h2>Grass roots start shallow in disturbed soil</h2>
  <p>Roots struggle to penetrate compacted layers.</p>
  <p>Shallow roots rely more on surface moisture.</p>
  <p>This keeps water near the top and worsens saturation.</p>

  <h2>New lawns are built on unfinished systems</h2>
  <p>A construction lawn is not a mature soil ecosystem.</p>
  <p>Structure, biology, and drainage pathways are incomplete.</p>
  <p>Until those systems rebuild, drainage problems are normal rather than unusual.</p>

  <h2>Poor drainage is a starting condition, not a mistake</h2>
  <p>Most new construction lawns are not failing because of bad care.</p>
  <p>They are reacting to the soil they were given.</p>
  <p>Improvement depends on time, root development, and structural recovery.</p>
