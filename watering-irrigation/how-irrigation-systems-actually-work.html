  <h1>How Irrigation Systems Actually Work</h1>

  <h2>They distribute water, they do not judge conditions</h2>
  <p>An irrigation system does one job: it moves water through pipes and throws it onto the yard in a repeatable pattern. It does not know whether the lawn is thirsty, whether the soil can accept more, or whether the last cycle actually reached the roots. The controller only knows time, and the hardware only knows flow.</p>
  <p>This is why a system can run “perfectly” and still produce a lawn that looks inconsistent.</p>

  <h2>Pressure is the hidden driver of coverage</h2>
  <p>Most of what people call “coverage” is really pressure behavior.</p>
  <p>Pressure changes how far a head throws, how evenly it sprays, and whether it produces a fine mist or larger droplets. Small pressure shifts across a yard can create big differences in how much water actually lands in each area, even when every zone runs for the same number of minutes.</p>

  <h2>Spacing creates overlap, and overlap creates the final dose</h2>
  <p>Sprinkler heads are meant to overlap because a single head rarely applies evenly from center to edge.</p>
  <p>The system assumes neighboring heads will fill in each other’s weak spots, so the intended amount is created by multiple patterns stacking together. When spacing is off, or when one head underperforms, the overlap map changes and the lawn receives a different dose than the schedule suggests.</p>

  <h2>Runtime is not the same thing as water delivered</h2>
  <p>Minutes on a timer sound precise, but they are not a measurement of water in the soil.</p>
  <p>Two zones can run for the same time and still deliver different amounts because of nozzle size, pressure loss, or partial blockage. This is why a schedule can look reasonable on paper while the yard behaves like it is being watered randomly.</p>

  <h2>The soil decides what happens after the water lands</h2>
  <p>An irrigation system can only place water on the surface.</p>
  <p>After that, the soil decides whether water soaks in, spreads, drains, or pools. If the application rate exceeds what the surface can accept at that moment, water escapes instead of becoming usable moisture, which connects directly to <a href="/watering-irrigation/why-water-runs-off-instead-of-soaking-in.html">Why Water Runs Off Instead of Soaking In</a>.</p>

  <h2>Fast-draining soils turn mistakes into rapid stress</h2>
  <p>In soils that release water quickly, the system’s pattern matters more than people think.</p>
  <p>If water lands unevenly, fast-draining areas cannot “average out” over time because the moisture is gone before the next cycle. This is part of what makes sandy lawns so sensitive to timing and distribution, as described in <a href="/watering-irrigation/how-sandy-soil-handles-water.html">How Sandy Soil Handles Water</a>.</p>

  <h2>Slow-draining soils hide problems until they accumulate</h2>
  <p>When soil drains poorly, the system can be over-delivering without immediate symptoms.</p>
  <p>Moisture lingers between cycles, oxygen movement drops, and the lawn starts acting weak even though it looks dark and wet. These slow failures are a common path into the conditions described in <a href="/watering-irrigation/why-some-lawns-never-dry-out.html">Why Some Lawns Never Dry Out</a>.</p>

  <h2>Distribution problems rarely look like a sprinkler problem</h2>
  <p>Most people expect an irrigation issue to look like a dead strip or a clearly dry corner.</p>
  <p>More often it looks like uneven growth, inconsistent color, or a lawn that swings between too wet and too dry depending on weather. That happens because the system is distributing a pattern, not delivering a consistent soil result.</p>

  <h2>Controllers create repetition, which can lock in errors</h2>
  <p>Automation is powerful because it repeats the same event on schedule.</p>
  <p>If the pattern is wrong, that repetition does not fix anything; it trains the lawn into a predictable decline. A system can run daily and still miss roots, over-soak low spots, and push stress into the same areas over and over.</p>

  <h2>The real output is not water on the lawn, it is water in the root zone</h2>
  <p>Irrigation looks simple because you can see it spray, but the outcome is decided underground.</p>
  <p>When the system’s distribution does not match what the soil can accept, the visible watering event becomes misleading, and the lawn responds with inconsistency instead of stability.</p>
