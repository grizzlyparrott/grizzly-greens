  <h1>Why Poor Drainage Encourages Disease</h1>

  <h2>Poor drainage makes “wet” last too long</h2>
  <p>Grass can handle getting wet because it expects to dry out on schedule. Poor drainage breaks that schedule by holding water in place. The lawn stays in the wrong state after the event is over.</p>
  <p>That delay is where disease starts winning. The turf never gets a clean reset.</p>

  <h2>Soft turf takes more damage from normal use</h2>
  <p>When blades stay damp, they stay softer and easier to scuff. Mowing, walking, and pets cause more tiny injuries than they would on a firm lawn. Those openings show up everywhere, not just in one spot. Disease doesn’t need a big wound when it gets lots of small ones.</p>
  <p>Wet time turns routine contact into repeated exposure.</p>

  <h2>Waterlogged soil weakens the lawn from below</h2>
  <p>Drainage problems are not only on the surface. When soil stays saturated, air movement drops and roots slow down. The lawn loses internal support even while it still looks green.</p>
  <p>Weak roots don’t push steady growth. Weak growth can’t replace stressed tissue fast enough. The lawn begins falling behind.</p>

  <h2>Stalled growth keeps infected tissue in play</h2>
  <p>A healthy lawn can outgrow early infection.</p>
  <p>When drainage is poor, the same wetness that starts disease also slows the regrowth that would normally cover it. Infected blades stay exposed longer.</p>

  <h2>Moisture stays consistent, so spread stays consistent</h2>
  <p>Disease pressure rises when wetness doesn’t have breaks. Poor drainage extends rain, irrigation, and dew into longer wet periods.</p>
  <p>Total wet hours stack up across the week. The lawn rarely gets a full dry pause. That makes small outbreaks connect into patches. Once patches form, recovery takes longer even if weather improves.</p>

  <h2>The same areas keep failing because the same condition stays</h2>
  <p>Low spots and slow-draining zones stay wetter than the rest of the yard. Those areas weaken first after every wet cycle. Disease keeps returning because the environment never actually changes.</p>
  <p>The same failures can reappear year after year even with different weather, a pattern covered in <a href="/watering-irrigation/why-water-problems-reappear-each-year.html">Why Water Problems Reappear Each Year</a>.</p>

  <h2>Drainage solutions matter because they shorten the wet window</h2>
  <p>A lawn doesn’t need to be dry all the time to be healthy. It needs wetness to end quickly enough for recovery to finish. Shortening that window removes the steady advantage disease relies on.</p>
  <p>Better drainage reduces how long tissue stays vulnerable and how long roots stay stressed. It also restores a predictable dry-down rhythm, as described in <a href="/watering-irrigation/what-lawn-drainage-systems-do.html">What Lawn Drainage Systems Do</a>.</p>

  <h2>Disease becomes the symptom of time, not a random event</h2>
  <p>Poor drainage gives disease time and gives the lawn weakness at the same time. Over repeated cycles, turf density drops and the surface stays easier to infect. Each round ends with less healthy grass than the last.</p>
  <p>Once wet time keeps outlasting recovery time, the lawn can’t rebuild momentum.</p>
