  <h1>Why Lawns Near Concrete Dry Faster</h1>

  <h2>Concrete absorbs and releases heat continuously</h2>
  <p>Concrete acts like a heat reservoir.</p>
  <p>It absorbs solar energy during the day and releases it back into the surrounding air and soil for hours afterward. Grass growing beside it experiences higher temperatures for longer periods, which accelerates moisture loss well beyond what nearby open turf experiences.</p>

  <h2>Soil temperatures rise at the edge</h2>
  <p>Heat transfers laterally from hard surfaces.</p>
  <p>That transfer warms the soil next to sidewalks and driveways, increasing evaporation below the surface. Roots in these zones lose access to usable moisture sooner, even when watering volume matches the rest of the lawn.</p>

  <h2>Air movement strips moisture faster</h2>
  <p>Hard surfaces alter airflow.</p>
  <p>Wind speeds increase along concrete edges, pulling moisture from grass blades and soil at a faster rate. This effect compounds heat loss rather than replacing it.</p>

  <h2>Water moves away instead of soaking evenly</h2>
  <p>Concrete sheds water by design.</p>
  <p>Irrigation and rainfall often run off the surface and away from the edge, reducing infiltration right where grass is already under stress. This behavior often surprises homeowners who assume equal coverage means equal absorption.</p>

  <h2>Timing becomes more critical near hardscapes</h2>
  <p>Moisture windows close faster in these zones.</p>
  <p>Water applied too early may evaporate before roots benefit, while water applied too late may not cool the soil effectively. This sensitivity is one reason timing matters as explained in <a href="/watering-irrigation/best-time-of-day-to-water-a-lawn.html">Best Time of Day to Water a Lawn</a>.</p>

  <h2>Irrigation systems rarely compensate automatically</h2>
  <p>Most systems distribute water evenly, not intelligently.</p>
  <p>They do not adjust output based on heat load or surface conditions. Understanding this limitation requires looking at how distribution actually works, as outlined in <a href="/watering-irrigation/how-irrigation-systems-actually-work.html">How Irrigation Systems Actually Work</a>.</p>

  <h2>Root demand increases without visible warning</h2>
  <p>Grass near concrete uses more water per hour.</p>
  <p>That higher demand is not obvious until stress appears, which leads many people to underestimate how quickly these areas fall behind normal turf.</p>

  <h2>Uniform watering creates unequal results</h2>
  <p>The same volume does not meet the same need.</p>
  <p>Edge zones dry out first even when the lawn as a whole seems adequately watered. This mismatch often conflicts with expectations formed by general guidance such as <a href="/watering-irrigation/how-much-water-grass-actually-needs.html">How Much Water Grass Actually Needs</a>.</p>

  <h2>Alternative delivery methods reduce edge losses</h2>
  <p>Surface spray is inefficient near concrete.</p>
  <p>Targeted delivery that limits evaporation and runoff can reduce stress along hard edges, which is why some situations align better with approaches described in <a href="/watering-irrigation/when-drip-irrigation-is-better.html">When Drip Irrigation Is Better</a>.</p>

  <h2>Concrete creates a permanent stress gradient</h2>
  <p>These conditions do not disappear over time.</p>
  <p>Lawns near concrete require tighter timing and closer attention because the environment constantly pulls moisture away faster than surrounding turf can lose it.</p>
