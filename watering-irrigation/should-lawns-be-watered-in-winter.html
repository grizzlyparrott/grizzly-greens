  <h1>Should Lawns Be Watered in Winter</h1>

  <h2>Winter changes how water behaves in soil</h2>
  <p>Cold temperatures slow evaporation and biological activity. Water stays in the soil longer, even when the surface looks dry.</p>
  <p>This shift means normal watering habits can easily overshoot what the lawn can process.</p>

  <h2>Grass uses less water when growth slows</h2>
  <p>Winter growth is minimal or paused entirely for many lawns. Roots pull far less moisture than they do in warm seasons.</p>
  <p>Adding water when demand is low leaves excess sitting in the soil.</p>

  <h2>Cold soil holds moisture longer than expected</h2>
  <p>Soil pores drain more slowly in winter. What would clear quickly in summer can linger for days.</p>
  <p>That trapped moisture keeps the root zone cold and limits oxygen movement.</p>

  <h2>Overwatering in winter delays spring recovery</h2>
  <p>Roots stressed by constant moisture lose efficiency. When temperatures rise, the lawn starts spring already behind.</p>
  <p>Recovery depends on soil warming, which excess water actively prevents.</p>

  <h2>Dry-looking grass can still be waterlogged</h2>
  <p>Faded color or stiffness does not always mean drought in winter. Those signs often come from cold stress instead.</p>
  <p>Watering based on appearance alone often makes the problem worse.</p>

  <h2>Irrigation timing drifts without obvious signs</h2>
  <p>Systems set for warm months rarely adjust themselves. Small timing errors compound quietly through winter.</p>
  <p>This gradual misalignment follows the same pattern described in <a href="/watering-irrigation/why-irrigation-systems-drift-over-time.html">Why Irrigation Systems Drift Over Time</a>.</p>

  <h2>Uniform coverage matters more in cold seasons</h2>
  <p>In winter, uneven watering creates pockets that stay wet far longer than the rest of the lawn.</p>
  <p>Understanding how systems distribute water helps explain why these patches form, as outlined in <a href="/watering-irrigation/how-irrigation-systems-actually-work.html">How Irrigation Systems Actually Work</a>.</p>

  <h2>Some winter watering is still necessary</h2>
  <p>Extended dry periods can still pull moisture from the soil. Completely dry roots are also damaging.</p>
  <p>The difference is that winter watering must respond to soil conditions, not schedules.</p>

  <h2>Winter watering is about restraint, not routine</h2>
  <p>Healthy lawns enter winter slightly drier than summer standards. That balance protects roots and preserves structure.</p>
  <p>Water only becomes helpful when it restores balance, not when it follows habit.</p>
