  <h1>Difference Between Surface and Subsurface Drainage</h1>

  <h2>Water can leave above ground or below it</h2>
  <p>Drainage works in two very different zones.</p>
  <p>Surface drainage deals with water you can see, while subsurface drainage controls moisture that never reaches the top. Confusing the two often leads to fixing the wrong problem.</p>

  <h2>Surface drainage handles excess on top</h2>
  <p>When water flows across the lawn or pools in low spots, surface drainage is involved.</p>
  <p>This type of movement is shaped by grading, slope, and how quickly water can escape without soaking in. It affects appearance first and structure later.</p>

  <h2>Subsurface drainage controls root conditions</h2>
  <p>Below the grass, water moves through soil pores and channels.</p>
  <p>Subsurface drainage determines how long roots sit in moisture and how quickly air returns. Problems here are invisible at first but usually cause more lasting damage.</p>

  <h2>Visible water does not tell the full story</h2>
  <p>A lawn can drain cleanly on the surface while staying saturated underneath.</p>
  <p>In those cases, grass may show stress patterns similar to <a href="/watering-irrigation/signs-a-lawn-is-overwatered.html">Signs a Lawn Is Overwatered</a> even when puddles never appear.</p>

  <h2>Surface fixes cannot repair subsurface failure</h2>
  <p>Redirecting runoff solves only what happens on top.</p>
  <p>If soil below cannot release water, moisture continues to linger where roots live. The lawn may look improved while function keeps declining.</p>

  <h2>Subsurface issues develop without obvious triggers</h2>
  <p>Compaction, soil layering, and repeated saturation change how water moves underground.</p>
  <p>These shifts happen gradually and often get blamed on watering habits instead of soil behavior.</p>

  <h2>Misunderstanding drainage fuels bad assumptions</h2>
  <p>Many common beliefs about lawn watering ignore the difference between surface and subsurface movement.</p>
  <p>This confusion shows up repeatedly in <a href="/watering-irrigation/common-lawn-watering-myths.html">Common Lawn Watering Myths</a>, where symptoms get mistaken for causes.</p>

  <h2>Surface problems spread outward</h2>
  <p>Water that cannot soak in must go somewhere.</p>
  <p>It flows to nearby areas, creating visible patterns that expand over time, especially after heavy rain.</p>

  <h2>Subsurface problems spread downward and sideways</h2>
  <p>When soil structure collapses, water movement slows in every direction.</p>
  <p>Roots retreat, channels close, and neighboring soil begins absorbing more load than it can handle.</p>

  <h2>The more hidden problem usually lasts longer</h2>
  <p>Surface drainage issues are easier to spot and correct.</p>
  <p>Subsurface failures linger because they change how the lawn functions, not just how it looks.</p>

  <h2>Knowing which system is failing changes the outcome</h2>
  <p>Fixing visible water without addressing hidden moisture leaves the real damage untouched.</p>
  <p>The difference between surface and subsurface drainage is not cosmetic. It decides whether the lawn recovers or keeps declining.</p>
