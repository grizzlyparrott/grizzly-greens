  <h1>How to Prepare Lawns for Dry Seasons</h1>

  <h2>Dry season damage begins before visible stress</h2>
  <p>Dry seasons punish lawns long before grass visibly wilts.</p>
  <p>Moisture loss accelerates below the surface while color appears stable. Roots shorten quietly and reduce buffering capacity. Preparation must start before symptoms appear.</p>

  <h2>Reduce surface runoff before soil dries hard</h2>
  <p>Hard surfaces repel water and worsen moisture loss.</p>
  <p>Compacted or sloped areas shed water instead of absorbing it. That runoff behavior is explained in <a href="/watering-irrigation/why-water-pools-on-lawns.html">Why Water Pools on Lawns</a>. Fixing flow paths early prevents wasted irrigation.</p>

  <h2>Understand how long moisture remains usable</h2>
  <p>Water only helps roots while oxygen exchange remains possible.</p>
  <p>Soil that stays wet too long suffocates roots instead of helping them. That threshold is detailed in <a href="/watering-irrigation/how-long-grass-can-stay-wet-safely.html">How Long Grass Can Stay Wet Safely</a>. Dry season prep depends on staying below that limit.</p>

  <h2>Avoid overwatering in anticipation of heat</h2>
  <p>Extra water does not store safely for later use.</p>
  <p>Overwatering weakens roots and encourages shallow growth. Excess moisture also increases weed pressure before drought begins. The mechanism behind that response is covered in <a href="/watering-irrigation/why-overwatering-encourages-weeds.html">Why Overwatering Encourages Weeds</a>.</p>

  <h2>Identify drainage weaknesses before demand spikes</h2>
  <p>Poor drainage creates uneven moisture distribution.</p>
  <p>Some areas dry excessively while others remain soft. That imbalance forces shallow rooting across the lawn. Common warning signs are outlined in <a href="/watering-irrigation/signs-of-poor-lawn-drainage.html">Signs of Poor Lawn Drainage</a>.</p>

  <h2>Strengthen roots instead of chasing color</h2>
  <p>Green color does not equal drought readiness.</p>
  <p>Root depth determines how long grass tolerates dry periods. Consistent drying cycles encourage deeper rooting. Surface-focused watering undermines that process.</p>

  <h2>Prepare mowing and traffic habits for dry soil</h2>
  <p>Dry soil damages easily under stress.</p>
  <p>Lower mowing frequency reduces moisture loss. Limiting traffic prevents surface sealing and root shear. Mechanical stress compounds drought damage quickly.</p>

  <h2>Expect uneven stress during the transition</h2>
  <p>Dry seasons rarely affect lawns uniformly.</p>
  <p>Sun exposure, slope, and soil variation create uneven demand. Some areas fail earlier despite correct watering. Preparation reduces spread but cannot eliminate variation.</p>

  <h2>Preparation is confirmed by predictable behavior</h2>
  <p>A prepared lawn shows consistent drying without sudden collapse.</p>
  <p>Stress appears gradually instead of instantly. Recovery still completes between watering cycles. When behavior remains predictable, preparation worked.</p>
