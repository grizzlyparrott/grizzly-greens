  <h1>Signs of Poor Lawn Drainage</h1>

  <h2>Drying takes longer than expected</h2>
  <p>A healthy lawn releases excess moisture within a predictable window.</p>
  <p>When grass stays dark and soft long after rain or irrigation, drainage has slowed. This delayed drying often appears even when the surface never fully floods.</p>

  <h2>Soft footing becomes the new normal</h2>
  <p>Repeated steps leave impressions instead of springing back.</p>
  <p>This softness is not cushioning. It signals soil particles floating in moisture instead of supporting structure.</p>

  <h2>Growth patterns stop matching watering patterns</h2>
  <p>Some areas surge while others stall under the same schedule.</p>
  <p>That mismatch reflects uneven moisture release, a hallmark of lawns described in <a href="/watering-irrigation/why-some-lawns-never-dry-out.html">Why Some Lawns Never Dry Out</a>, where water movement never equalizes.</p>

  <h2>Roots stay shallow despite regular care</h2>
  <p>Grass adapts quickly when deeper soil stays saturated.</p>
  <p>Roots retreat upward to survive, reducing stability and access to stored moisture. The lawn becomes dependent on frequent surface water even during mild weather.</p>

  <h2>Weeds gain ground without obvious neglect</h2>
  <p>Many weeds tolerate wet soil better than turfgrass.</p>
  <p>As drainage worsens, they fill gaps where grass weakens. This shift often mirrors the conditions discussed in <a href="/watering-irrigation/how-watering-impacts-weed-growth.html">How Watering Impacts Weed Growth</a>, where moisture imbalance changes competition.</p>

  <h2>Low areas appear without visible grading issues</h2>
  <p>Soft soil compresses under routine traffic.</p>
  <p>Mower passes and foot movement slowly create depressions, which then hold more water and accelerate the problem.</p>

  <h2>New lawns struggle to stabilize</h2>
  <p>Drainage issues often show up early on newly installed turf.</p>
  <p>Soil disturbance during building leaves layers compacted and uneven, leading to patterns seen in <a href="/watering-irrigation/why-new-construction-lawns-drain-poorly.html">Why New Construction Lawns Drain Poorly</a> even with proper watering.</p>

  <h2>Stress appears after rain, not before</h2>
  <p>Instead of bouncing back after moisture, the lawn looks worse.</p>
  <p>Yellowing, thinning, and slow response indicate roots losing function during saturation rather than drought.</p>

  <h2>Seasonal problems repeat in the same spots</h2>
  <p>Drainage issues are location-specific.</p>
  <p>The same patches struggle year after year because soil conditions do not reset on their own.</p>

  <h2>Poor drainage announces itself quietly</h2>
  <p>There is rarely a single dramatic failure.</p>
  <p>Instead, recovery slows, stress lingers, and performance declines until the signs can no longer be ignored.</p>
