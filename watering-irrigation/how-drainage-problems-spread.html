  <h1>How Drainage Problems Spread</h1>

  <h2>Failure expands from the slowest point</h2>
  <p>Drainage problems rarely appear everywhere at once.</p>
  <p>They begin where water lingers the longest, then expand outward as surrounding soil is forced to compensate. Each wet cycle increases the load on nearby areas.</p>

  <h2>Repeated saturation changes how soil behaves</h2>
  <p>Soil that stays wet too often loses its ability to reopen.</p>
  <p>Once pore spaces collapse, water no longer moves vertically. That slowdown pushes moisture sideways, spreading the problem into areas that previously drained fine.</p>

  <h2>Roots retreat ahead of visible damage</h2>
  <p>Grass reacts early to poor drainage by shortening roots.</p>
  <p>This reduces structure in the soil and removes natural channels for water to escape. The lawn can look passable while the conditions needed for spread are already in place.</p>

  <h2>Misplaced blame accelerates the spread</h2>
  <p>When drainage fails, watering often gets blamed.</p>
  <p>Adjustments meant to help can worsen conditions when water movement is the real issue, a situation described in <a href="/watering-irrigation/when-watering-is-not-the-real-problem.html">When Watering Is Not the Real Problem</a>, where symptoms mislead diagnosis.</p>

  <h2>Seasonal shifts expose weak transitions</h2>
  <p>Drainage systems rely on predictable drying windows.</p>
  <p>When seasons change, those windows shift. Soil that barely recovered in one season can stay wet too long in another, allowing the affected area to expand as outlined in <a href="/watering-irrigation/how-seasonal-changes-affect-watering.html">How Seasonal Changes Affect Watering</a>.</p>

  <h2>Soil type determines how fast problems travel</h2>
  <p>Some soils shed water quickly while others hold it tightly.</p>
  <p>In heavier soils, even small drainage failures spread faster because water has fewer escape paths. This behavior connects directly to <a href="/watering-irrigation/how-soil-type-affects-watering.html">How Soil Type Affects Watering</a>, where texture controls movement.</p>

  <h2>Traffic turns soft zones into anchors</h2>
  <p>Once soil softens, normal foot and mower traffic compress it.</p>
  <p>Those compacted spots drain even worse, becoming permanent collection points that pull moisture from surrounding ground.</p>

  <h2>Recovery slows as the affected area grows</h2>
  <p>Small drainage issues can recover naturally.</p>
  <p>As the problem spreads, recovery time lengthens. Each wet period leaves less intact structure behind to work with.</p>

  <h2>Visual boundaries lag behind real ones</h2>
  <p>The visible edge of damage is not the true edge.</p>
  <p>Soil outside the obvious area is already changing, which is why drainage problems often seem to jump suddenly rather than creep.</p>

  <h2>Spread continues until movement is restored</h2>
  <p>Drainage problems do not stabilize on their own.</p>
  <p>As long as water keeps lingering and shifting sideways, the affected area will continue to grow, regardless of how carefully watering is managed.</p>
