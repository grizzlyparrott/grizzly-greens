  <h1>Why Uneven Soil Causes Lawn Problems</h1>

  <h2>Uneven ground creates uneven root depth</h2>
  <p>Grass roots grow until they hit resistance or run out of space. When soil depth changes across a lawn, some areas give roots room while others cut them short.</p>
  <p>You notice this as patches that dry out faster, burn quicker in heat, or never thicken like the rest.</p>

  <h2>Low spots collect water while high spots shed it</h2>
  <p>Water follows gravity. Depressions hold moisture longer, while raised areas drain faster and dry sooner.</p>
  <p>You notice soggy grass, algae, or moss in low areas and stressed, thin grass just a few feet away on higher ground.</p>

  <h2>Uneven soil changes oxygen availability</h2>
  <p>Soil that stays wet loses oxygen, while soil that dries too fast collapses air spaces. Both conditions limit root function in different ways.</p>
  <p>You notice yellowing in wet areas and wilting in dry ones even though irrigation is uniform.</p>

  <h2>Mowing exposes uneven soil immediately</h2>
  <p>Blades cut lower on raised areas and higher over depressions. That scalping removes leaf tissue the plant needs to recover.</p>
  <p>You notice brown streaks after mowing that follow the shape of the ground rather than random patterns.</p>

  <h2>Traffic concentrates damage on uneven ground</h2>
  <p>People and equipment naturally step on the highest, firmest points. That pressure compacts soil faster in those zones.</p>
  <p>You notice thinning paths and worn ridges that match the same pressure patterns described in <a href="/soil-fertilizer/how-traffic-affects-soil-health.html">how traffic affects soil health</a>.</p>

  <h2>Uneven soil often comes from disturbed ground</h2>
  <p>Fill dirt, grading, and buried debris settle at different rates. The soil profile ends up inconsistent from one spot to the next.</p>
  <p>You notice persistent low areas and weak growth common to lawns affected by <a href="/soil-fertilizer/why-new-construction-soil-is-bad.html">new construction soil</a>.</p>

  <h2>Fertilizer and water amplify the differences</h2>
  <p>Inputs spread evenly, but the soil does not respond evenly. Nutrients move faster in some areas and linger in others.</p>
  <p>You notice uneven color, streaking, and patches that look overfed next to areas that look starved.</p>

  <h2>Uneven soil creates repeating failure zones</h2>
  <p>Once patterns form, stress returns to the same locations because the physical shape of the soil hasn’t changed.</p>
  <p>You notice the same spots failing every season regardless of care.</p>

  <h2>Fixing the surface fixes the pattern</h2>
  <p>Uneven soil causes lawn problems because it creates uneven conditions. Until the ground is corrected, symptoms repeat.</p>
  <p>When the soil is level, the lawn finally behaves like a single system instead of competing zones.</p>
