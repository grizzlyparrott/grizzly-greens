    <h1>Why Nutrients Wash Out of Soil</h1>

<h2>Nutrients move unless something slows them</h2>
<p>Nutrients do not stay put on their own. Once they dissolve in water, gravity and flow take over.</p>
<p>Soil only keeps nutrients in place when it has enough structure and activity to slow that movement.</p>

<h2>Water movement controls nutrient loss</h2>
<p>Any time water moves through soil, it carries dissolved nutrients with it.</p>
<p>If water passes quickly through the root zone, nutrients leave just as quickly.</p>

<h2>Loose or damaged soil leaks faster</h2>
<p>Soils with poor structure allow water to bypass roots instead of lingering.</p>
<p>This creates a situation where feeding looks correct on paper but produces little lasting benefit.</p>

<h2>Biology helps nutrients pause instead of flush</h2>
<p>Living roots and microbes temporarily capture nutrients and release them slowly.</p>
<p>When biological activity drops, nutrients arrive all at once and disappear just as fast.</p>

<h2>Timing matters as much as quantity</h2>
<p>Applying nutrients when roots are inactive increases loss.</p>
<p>If grass is not actively growing, nutrients have nothing to anchor them in place.</p>

<h2>Summer changes how soil behaves</h2>
<p>Heat alters moisture movement, microbial activity, and root behavior.</p>
<p>These shifts explain why nutrient performance often changes during hot months, as explored in <a href="/soil-fertilizer/why-soil-behaves-differently-in-summer.html">Why Soil Behaves Differently in Summer</a>.</p>

<h2>Washout fuels weeds more than grass</h2>
<p>When nutrients move away from roots, opportunistic plants often intercept them first.</p>
<p>This is one reason weed pressure can increase even when lawns are fertilized correctly, making accurate identification important, as outlined in <a href="/weeds-pests/how-to-tell-one-weed-from-another.html">How to Tell One Weed From Another</a>.</p>

<h2>Repeated feeding often signals repeated loss</h2>
<p>Lawns that require frequent fertilizer are usually not hungry.</p>
<p>They are leaking.</p>

<h2>Surface fixes do not stop movement</h2>
<p>Changing products does not change how water moves through soil.</p>
<p>Until soil behavior slows flow, nutrients will continue to leave.</p>

<h2>Holding nutrients is a soil function</h2>
<p>Long-term success comes from improving how soil manages water and roots.</p>
<p>When nutrients slow down, feeding becomes supportive instead of constant replacement.</p>

<h2>Washout explains inconsistent results</h2>
<p>Uneven color, patchy growth, and short-lived response often point to nutrient movement, not deficiency.</p>
<p>Understanding washout shifts focus from feeding more to fixing why nutrients cannot stay.</p>
