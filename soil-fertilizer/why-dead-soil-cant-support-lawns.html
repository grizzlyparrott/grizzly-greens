  <h1>Why Dead Soil Can’t Support Lawns</h1>

  <h2>Dead soil means the ground stopped doing its job</h2>
  <p>Dead soil isn’t just dry or low quality dirt. It’s soil that no longer works the way grass needs it to. When soil stops letting air, water, and roots move normally, grass slowly runs out of ways to survive.</p>
  <p>No amount of watering or fertilizer can fix soil that isn’t functioning.</p>

  <h2>Grass roots need air, not just water</h2>
  <p>Roots don’t only drink water. They also need air. When soil becomes hard or packed down, air can’t move underground. Roots begin to suffocate even though the lawn may look fine at first.</p>
  <p>By the time grass looks stressed, the damage has already been happening for a while.</p>

  <h2>Healthy soil stays loose and open</h2>
  <p>Good soil stays crumbly and flexible. It can absorb footsteps, rain, and mowing without turning hard. Dead soil loses that flexibility and starts acting more like concrete.</p>
  <p>This is one of the biggest differences you’ll notice when comparing problem lawns to the <a href="/soil-fertilizer/signs-of-healthy-lawn-soil.html">signs of healthy lawn soil</a>.</p>

  <h2>Dead soil ruins how water moves</h2>
  <p>When soil is healthy, water soaks in evenly and reaches the roots. When soil is dead, water either puddles on top or drains away too fast. Grass ends up either drowning or drying out.</p>
  <p>This is why watering feels unpredictable when the real issue is <a href="/soil-fertilizer/what-soil-drainage-really-means.html">how the soil handles water</a>.</p>

  <h2>Fertilizer can’t fix broken soil</h2>
  <p>Dead soil can still contain nutrients, but grass can’t reach them. Fertilizer adds more material to soil that already can’t deliver what’s there.</p>
  <p>The lawn keeps declining even though you’re “doing everything right.”</p>

  <h2>Dead soil doesn’t recover on its own</h2>
  <p>Healthy soil can bounce back from stress. Dead soil can’t. Each season makes the problem worse instead of better. Foot traffic, weather, and mowing all take a toll that never gets repaired.</p>
  <p>The lawn slowly thins year after year.</p>

  <h2>This is why some lawns never improve</h2>
  <p>If a lawn keeps failing no matter how much effort you put in, the problem usually isn’t the grass. It’s the soil underneath.</p>
  <p>Grass can’t outgrow bad ground.</p>

  <h2>Lawns only live as long as the soil does</h2>
  <p>Grass depends entirely on soil doing its job. Once soil stops working, everything above it becomes temporary.</p>
  <p>Dead soil can’t support living lawns.</p>
