    <h1>What Fertilizer Does and Does Not Do</h1>

<h2>Fertilizer feeds plants, not soil structure</h2>
<p>Fertilizer provides nutrients that grass uses to grow. That is all it does. It does not loosen soil, improve drainage, or create space for roots.</p>
<p>When fertilizer appears to fail, it is usually being asked to solve a problem it cannot physically address.</p>

<h2>Fertilizer cannot create root space</h2>
<p>Roots need room to grow, air to breathe, and water that behaves predictably. Fertilizer does not change any of those conditions.</p>
<p>If soil is compacted or layered, nutrients may be present but unreachable.</p>

<h2>Color response is not the same as health</h2>
<p>Fertilizer often causes quick greening because leaves respond faster than roots.</p>
<p>That visual improvement can hide ongoing root stress, which is why lawns can look better briefly and then decline again.</p>

<h2>Fertilizer depends entirely on soil behavior</h2>
<p>Nutrients only help when soil can hold them, move them, and deliver them to roots.</p>
<p>When soil chemistry adjustments are useful, they work only within those limits, which is why products like sulfur matter only in the context explained in <a href="/soil-fertilizer/how-sulfur-affects-lawn-soil.html">How Sulfur Affects Lawn Soil</a>.</p>

<h2>Fertilizer does not repair damaged soil</h2>
<p>Soil damaged by compaction, erosion, or construction does not recover because nutrients were added.</p>
<p>In those cases, fertilizer often accumulates near the surface, increasing stress instead of solving it.</p>

<h2>New construction soil exposes fertilizer limits quickly</h2>
<p>Lawns installed on construction sites often receive plenty of fertilizer and still struggle.</p>
<p>The underlying issue is not nutrition but physical soil damage, which is why patterns described in <a href="/soil-fertilizer/why-new-construction-soil-is-bad.html">Why New Construction Soil Is Bad</a> persist despite feeding.</p>

<h2>More fertilizer increases risk without fixing causes</h2>
<p>When fertilizer does not work, applying more usually makes things worse.</p>
<p>Roots under stress cannot regulate uptake, leading to burn, imbalance, or further decline.</p>

<h2>There is a point where feeding stops making sense</h2>
<p>If soil cannot support roots at all, fertilizing becomes counterproductive.</p>
<p>At that stage, the real decision is structural, not nutritional, which is why evaluating options outlined in <a href="/soil-fertilizer/how-to-decide-between-fixing-or-replacing-soi.html">How to Decide Between Fixing or Replacing Soil</a> becomes necessary.</p>

<h2>Fertilizer works best after soil problems are addressed</h2>
<p>Once soil structure allows air, water, and roots to function, fertilizer becomes effective again.</p>
<p>At that point, nutrients support growth instead of masking stress.</p>

<h2>Knowing fertilizer’s limits prevents wasted effort</h2>
<p>Fertilizer is a tool, not a cure.</p>
<p>Using it correctly means understanding exactly what it can do, and just as importantly, what it cannot.</p>
