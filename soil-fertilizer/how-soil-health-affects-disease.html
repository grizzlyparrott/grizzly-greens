  <h1>How Soil Health Affects Disease</h1>

  <h2>Disease pressure rises when roots are stressed</h2>
  <p>Grass resists disease only when roots can breathe, absorb water evenly, and recover from damage. Poor soil restricts oxygen and root movement, weakening the plant before pathogens ever attack.</p>
  <p>You notice disease showing up in the same thin or stressed areas instead of spreading evenly across healthy turf.</p>

  <h2>Wet soil creates the conditions disease needs</h2>
  <p>When soil holds water too long, air spaces fill and roots suffocate. Fungal organisms thrive in those low-oxygen, constantly damp conditions.</p>
  <p>You notice circular patches, greasy-looking grass, or slow dieback that lines up with areas described in <a href="/soil-fertilizer/why-soil-stays-wet-too-long.html">why soil stays wet too long</a>.</p>

  <h2>Soil balance controls how long leaves stay wet</h2>
  <p>Healthy soil drains excess water and pulls moisture away from the surface. Poor soil keeps the surface damp longer after rain or irrigation.</p>
  <p>You notice disease appearing after dew, rain, or evening watering because moisture lingers on stressed grass.</p>

  <h2>pH problems weaken grass defenses</h2>
  <p>When soil pH drifts out of range, roots struggle to absorb nutrients needed for cell strength and repair. Grass becomes more vulnerable even without visible deficiency.</p>
  <p>You notice disease coinciding with lime applications or imbalance issues tied to <a href="/soil-fertilizer/how-lime-affects-lawn-soil.html">how lime affects lawn soil</a>.</p>

  <h2>Amendments reduce disease only when structure improves</h2>
  <p>Soil amendments work by improving air and water movement, not by killing pathogens. If amendments don’t change structure, disease pressure stays the same.</p>
  <p>You notice improvement only when soil behavior changes the way described in <a href="/soil-fertilizer/what-soil-amendments-are.html">what soil amendments are</a>.</p>

  <h2>Low organic matter leaves soil unstable</h2>
  <p>Organic material helps soil drain, resist compaction, and support root recovery. Without enough, soil swings between soggy and hard.</p>
  <p>You notice repeated disease outbreaks in areas that never reach the balance described in <a href="/soil-fertilizer/how-much-organic-matter-lawns-need.html">how much organic matter lawns need</a>.</p>

  <h2>Disease appears where soil recovery stalls</h2>
  <p>Grass recovers from minor disease pressure when roots stay active. Poor soil prevents that rebound, letting disease spread or return.</p>
  <p>You notice the same patches getting sick again even after fungicide treatments.</p>

  <h2>Disease is a symptom of soil failure</h2>
  <p>Pathogens are always present. They only dominate when soil stops supporting grass properly.</p>
  <p>Fixing soil health reduces disease pressure because the lawn stops being an easy target.</p>
