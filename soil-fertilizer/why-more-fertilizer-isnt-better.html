    <h1>Why More Fertilizer Isn’t Better</h1>

<h2>Fertilizer works by pushing growth, not fixing limits</h2>
<p>Fertilizer increases growth by supplying concentrated nutrients. It does not repair soil structure, improve root space, or stabilize moisture.</p>
<p>When those limits exist, more fertilizer only pushes the lawn harder against them.</p>

<h2>Extra feeding increases stress before it increases strength</h2>
<p>Every surge of growth increases demand for water, oxygen, and root support.</p>
<p>If the soil cannot meet that demand, the lawn spends energy faster than it can recover.</p>

<h2>Roots weaken as top growth accelerates</h2>
<p>Excess fertilizer favors leaf production over root development.</p>
<p>As roots lag behind, the lawn becomes visually impressive but structurally fragile.</p>

<h2>Short-term results hide long-term decline</h2>
<p>More fertilizer often produces darker color and faster fill-in.</p>
<p>Those gains fade quickly because the soil never changed, a mismatch that becomes clear once the true role of fertilizer is understood, as explained in <a href="/soil-fertilizer/what-fertilizer-really-is.html">What Fertilizer Really Is</a>.</p>

<h2>Excess nutrients create movement instead of stability</h2>
<p>Soil can only hold so much at one time.</p>
<p>Beyond that point, nutrients move with water rather than feeding roots, especially on slopes where runoff accelerates loss in the way described in <a href="/soil-fertilizer/why-sloped-lawns-lose-soil.html">Why Sloped Lawns Lose Soil</a>.</p>

<h2>More fertilizer shortens the benefit window</h2>
<p>Heavy feeding produces fast growth followed by faster drop-off.</p>
<p>The lawn swings between peaks and crashes instead of settling into steady performance.</p>

<h2>Overfeeding creates dependency</h2>
<p>When grass is constantly pushed, it adapts to frequent inputs.</p>
<p>Missed applications lead to rapid decline because roots never developed independence.</p>

<h2>Soil health determines how much is enough</h2>
<p>In stable soil, modest fertilizer rates go a long way.</p>
<p>In weak soil, even large amounts fail to produce lasting improvement.</p>

<h2>Frequency matters more than quantity</h2>
<p>How often fertilizer is applied has a greater impact than how much is applied at once.</p>
<p>That balance is why expectations around timing described in <a href="/soil-fertilizer/how-often-lawns-actually-need-fertilizer.html">How Often Lawns Actually Need Fertilizer</a> are more reliable than chasing stronger results.</p>

<h2>More input increases the cost of mistakes</h2>
<p>Higher rates leave less room for error.</p>
<p>Heat, drought, or watering gaps turn excess fertilizer from support into damage.</p>

<h2>Better lawns are built with restraint</h2>
<p>Strong lawns are not the most fed. They are the most balanced.</p>
<p>Using fertilizer to support existing capacity instead of forcing performance produces steadier growth and fewer setbacks.</p>

<h2>More fertilizer reveals limits instead of fixing them</h2>
<p>When adding more stops improving results, the message is clear.</p>
<p>The soil has become the limiting factor, and no increase in feeding will change that.</p>
