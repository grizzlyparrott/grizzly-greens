  <h1>How Seasonal Changes Affect Soil</h1>

  <h2>Soil expands and contracts as conditions change</h2>
  <p>Temperature and moisture cause soil particles to swell and shrink. Wet periods make soil heavier and tighter, while dry periods pull particles apart and create cracks.</p>
  <p>You notice this as soil that feels soft and spongy during wet seasons, then turns hard and brittle during dry ones.</p>

  <h2>Spring moisture exposes weak structure</h2>
  <p>As snow melts or rain increases, water fills soil spaces. If structure is weak, those spaces collapse and oxygen gets pushed out.</p>
  <p>You notice this as soggy lawns, slow green-up, and footprints that linger longer than they should.</p>

  <h2>Summer heat magnifies soil limits</h2>
  <p>High temperatures dry the soil surface and increase water demand. Shallow or compacted soil can’t store enough moisture or air for roots.</p>
  <p>You notice this as grass that wilts quickly, burns in patches, and needs frequent watering just to stay alive.</p>

  <h2>Fall cooling slows soil recovery</h2>
  <p>As temperatures drop, biological activity and root growth slow down. Any compaction or damage left from summer stress remains in place.</p>
  <p>You notice thin areas failing to fill in before winter, locking problems in for the next season.</p>

  <h2>Freeze cycles physically break soil apart</h2>
  <p>When water inside soil freezes, it expands. That expansion shifts particles and lifts the surface. When thawing occurs, soil settles unevenly.</p>
  <p>You notice this as heaving, uneven ground, and grass that loosens or lifts, which is the same process behind <a href="/soil-fertilizer/why-frozen-soil-damages-lawns.html">why frozen soil damages lawns</a>.</p>

  <h2>Seasonal damage gets mistaken for care mistakes</h2>
  <p>Because these changes happen gradually, seasonal soil behavior is often blamed on watering, mowing, or fertilizer timing.</p>
  <p>You notice people chasing fixes that don’t stick because the real cause is seasonal movement, not the myths described in <a href="/soil-fertilizer/common-lawn-soil-myths.html">common lawn soil myths</a>.</p>

  <h2>Soil remembers stress from previous seasons</h2>
  <p>Soil does not reset each year. Compaction, settling, and structure loss carry forward.</p>
  <p>You notice the same weak spots showing up earlier each season as the soil slowly loses resilience.</p>

  <h2>Seasonal changes don’t cause problems, they reveal them</h2>
  <p>Weather cycles don’t break healthy soil. They expose soil that already can’t handle movement and pressure.</p>
  <p>When soil is stable, seasonal changes pass without lasting damage.</p>
