  <h1>How Lime Affects Lawn Soil</h1>

  <h2>Lime works by changing soil chemistry, not feeding grass</h2>
  <p>Lime alters soil by raising pH through chemical neutralization of acidity. It does not supply nutrients in the way fertilizer does and does not directly stimulate growth.</p>
  <p>Its value comes from changing how existing nutrients behave and how roots interact with the soil environment.</p>

  <h2>Soil pH controls nutrient availability</h2>
  <p>In acidic soil, several essential nutrients become less available to roots while others become overly soluble. This imbalance restricts uptake even when nutrients are present.</p>
  <p>By raising pH toward a neutral range, lime shifts nutrients into forms roots can absorb more consistently.</p>

  <h2>Calcium from lime affects soil structure</h2>
  <p>Lime supplies calcium, which helps soil particles bind into stable aggregates. This aggregation improves pore space and reduces surface sealing.</p>
  <p>The result is improved air movement and more predictable water infiltration when soil texture allows aggregation to occur.</p>

  <h2>Lime changes biological activity underground</h2>
  <p>Most soil organisms function best within a moderate pH range. Strong acidity suppresses microbial activity and slows organic matter breakdown.</p>
  <p>As pH rises, biological processes accelerate, supporting root growth and soil recovery when other conditions are favorable.</p>

  <h2>Lime does not fix compaction or poor drainage</h2>
  <p>While lime can improve aggregation, it cannot reopen severely compacted soil or create drainage where structure has collapsed.</p>
  <p>In soils with physical damage, lime may improve chemistry without resolving the underlying limitation.</p>

  <h2>Over-liming creates new problems</h2>
  <p>Excessive lime can push soil pH too high, locking up iron, manganese, and phosphorus. Grass may yellow or weaken even though nutrients are present.</p>
  <p>Once pH overshoots, correction is slow and difficult because lime reactions persist in soil for years.</p>

  <h2>Results appear slowly and unevenly</h2>
  <p>Lime reacts gradually as it moves through soil with water. Changes start near the surface and progress downward over time.</p>
  <p>Visible effects often lag application by months, especially in dry or compacted soil.</p>

  <h2>Lime is a correction tool, not routine maintenance</h2>
  <p>Lime only helps when soil acidity is limiting function. Applying it without confirming low pH introduces unnecessary risk.</p>
  <p>When soil chemistry is already balanced, lime adds no benefit and can quietly reduce performance.</p>

  <h2>Soil response determines whether lime was appropriate</h2>
  <p>When lime is needed, grass gradually roots deeper, nutrient response stabilizes, and stress tolerance improves.</p>
  <p>If those changes do not occur, the limiting factor lies elsewhere in the soil system.</p>
