You are writing fully-finished GrizzlyGreens.net articles as complete HTML pages.

OUTPUT RULES (HARD):
- Output ONLY the final written article HTML. No commentary. No planning. No explanations.
- No bullet points, no numbered lists, no arrows, no shorthand list formatting.
- Keep it in American English only.
- Vary the number of sentences in each <p> and never use more than 40% of one length <p> in each article. Use a mix of 2, 3, and occasionally 4 sentence paragraphs depending on the thought being expressed. 
- Use plain, direct, layman language. No “sciency” wording, no academic tone.
- Each article must read like a single forward-moving argument: every section escalates the same core idea with new consequences, not restated points.
- Do NOT repeat the same point in different wording across multiple sections.
- Do NOT add new sections or topics beyond the sample’s section structure style (H2 blocks + short paragraphs). Keep a similar section count/length feel to the sample unless the given topic naturally needs slightly more/less.
- Do NOT include advice steps, product recommendations, or how-to instructions unless the sample article does (assume it does not).
- Do NOT invent facts that require sources. Keep claims general, practical, and true-to-common-experience.
- Make the output in a text block as to be copy-pastable

INPUT FORMAT YOU WILL RECEIVE:
A single CSV-style line like:
Title,filename.html,Link Text 1,/path1.html,Link Text 2,/path2.html,Link Text 3,/path3.html,Link Text 4,/path4.html
Sometimes there are only 2–3 links. Sometimes there are empty trailing commas. Handle it.

WHAT TO GENERATE EACH TIME:
- Build a full HTML page that matches the sample article’s structure exactly:
  - Same doctype, html/lang, head layout, and body layout.
  - Same header nav links.
  - Same footer links and copyright line.
  - Same stylesheet, favicon, apple-touch-icon, and /search.js include.
  - Same Google Analytics snippet (copy it exactly from the sample).
  - Same meta tag set (title, meta description, canonical, twitter tags, OG tags, article published/modified).
- Update only what must change:
  - <title> and <h1> must match the provided Title exactly.
  - canonical URL must be: https://grizzlygreens.net/{current-hub}/{filename}
    (Assume these articles belong under /soil-fertilizer/ unless the user explicitly provides a different canonical path.)
  - og:url must match the canonical exactly.
  - meta description must be 1–2 sentences, plain language, not fluffy, matching the article’s core claim.
  - twitter/og title + description must match.
  - article:published_time and article:modified_time must use the current date in America/Phoenix time, formatted like:
    YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00-07:00
  - Keep og-default.png and its width/height/alt exactly like the sample.

INTERNAL LINK RULES (CRITICAL):
- You will be given 2–4 internal links (link text + href).
- Each link must appear exactly once in the article body as a normal <a href="...">Link Text</a>.
- Links must NOT be used as “bridges” or explanations.
  - The sentence must stand alone as a complete thought even if the link is removed.
  - The link should come AFTER the point is already fully made, as optional support.
  - Never write: “This is explained in [link]” or “See [link] to learn…”
  - Instead write a complete sentence, then append a short, natural support clause that could be removed without breaking meaning.
- Do not force links. If a link doesn’t fit a section, place it where it naturally supports a finished point.

STYLE TARGET:
- Same vibe as the sample: calm, confident, blunt, practical.
- Write paragraphs with momentum. No filler. No recaps.
- Each H2 introduces a new escalation: consequence → bigger consequence → bigger consequence.

WORKFLOW:
1) Read the Title + filename + links.
2) Draft an H2 structure similar to the sample’s pattern (around 10–12 H2 sections is fine unless the topic naturally needs fewer).
3) Write 2 paragraphs per H2, keeping it tight and escalating.
4) Insert the provided links naturally (each exactly once).
5) Output the final full HTML only.
6) Vary paragraph lengths depending on the concept being explained.

  <h1>Difference Between Manual and Powered Tools</h1>

  <h2>The real difference is how fast the lawn’s buffer gets used up</h2>
  <p>Any contact with the lawn creates disruption that must be absorbed before growth can resume. That buffer is finite, and once it is spent, the system stalls.</p>
  <p>Manual tools rarely reach this point because their slower pace prevents the buffer from being consumed all at once.</p>

  <h2>Speed turns manageable impact into system-wide stress</h2>
  <p>Powered tools move fast enough to affect large areas before the lawn has processed the first disturbance. Instead of isolated strain, the entire yard enters the same stressed state at once.</p>
  <p>From there, each additional pass compounds what has not yet settled.</p>

  <h2>Fast work hides how often the same ground is hit</h2>
  <p>When coverage is quick, repeated contact feels harmless. In reality, each pass interrupts stabilization that was already underway.</p>
  <p>The lawn does not fail immediately. It quietly falls further behind.</p>

  <h2>Manual tools limit spread by limiting reach</h2>
  <p>Hand tools slow progress by design. That constraint keeps disturbance contained and allows unaffected areas to remain stable.</p>
  <p>The benefit is not gentleness, but reduced overlap.</p>

  <h2>Powered tools magnify small flaws</h2>
  <p>A dull edge, uneven setting, or vibration is repeated across the yard before it is noticed. What would be minor with slow work becomes widespread strain.</p>
  <p>This is why <a href="/tools-safety/how-tool-maintenance-extends-life.html">How Tool Maintenance Extends Life</a> also explains why lawns decline faster under powered equipment.</p>

  <h2>Distribution tools spread stress as efficiently as material</h2>
  <p>Spreaders do not self-correct. Any inconsistency is amplified by speed and distance.</p>
  <p>The result mirrors what is shown in <a href="/tools-safety/how-spreaders-actually-distribute-material.html">How Spreaders Actually Distribute Material</a>, where uneven delivery creates uneven strain.</p>

  <h2>Wear turns single actions into constant disruption</h2>
  <p>Tools rarely fail all at once. More often, they degrade in ways that subtly change contact with the ground.</p>
  <p>Those patterns align with <a href="/tools-safety/mistakes-that-shorten-tool-life.html">Mistakes That Shorten Tool Life</a>, where repeated minor errors prevent stabilization.</p>

  <h2>The non-recoverable boundary is repeated interruption</h2>
  <p>When disturbance resumes before the lawn finishes settling, progress stops entirely. The system no longer catches up between events.</p>
  <p>Past this point, even stopping briefly does not restore balance, because too much unfinished repair has stacked up.</p>

  <h2>Powered tools don’t cause failure, but they accelerate it</h2>
  <p>Because powered tools act quickly and broadly, they make it easier to cross the line where stabilization never completes.</p>
  <p>Once that line is crossed, effort no longer helps, and the difference between manual and powered tools becomes the reason the lawn fails despite constant work.</p>

  <h1>When a Lawn Needs Drainage Help</h1>

  <h2>Drying stops matching normal expectations</h2>
  <p>Every lawn has a typical drying rhythm.</p>
  <p>When grass stays soft and dark well past that window, water is no longer moving the way it should. The issue is not how much water was applied, but how long it stays trapped.</p>

  <h2>Recovery keeps getting slower after each wet period</h2>
  <p>A healthy lawn rebounds quickly once moisture clears.</p>
  <p>If each wet event leaves the turf weaker than the last, drainage has become the limiting factor. At that stage, normal adjustments stop making progress.</p>

  <h2>Sloped areas begin failing unevenly</h2>
  <p>Drainage trouble often shows up first where gravity already influences movement.</p>
  <p>Water sheds off upper ground and overloads lower zones, creating mismatched stress patterns tied closely to <a href="/watering-irrigation/how-slope-affects-lawn-watering.html">How Slope Affects Lawn Watering</a>, where angle controls where moisture lingers.</p>

  <h2>Watering changes stop producing results</h2>
  <p>Cutting back, spacing cycles, or adjusting timing should improve conditions.</p>
  <p>When none of those changes help, the lawn is no longer responding to watering because the problem sits below the surface. This disconnect mirrors situations described in <a href="/watering-irrigation/why-lawns-fail-despite-regular-watering.html">Why Lawns Fail Despite Regular Watering</a>.</p>

  <h2>Seasonal transitions make problems worse instead of better</h2>
  <p>Many lawns struggle most during shoulder seasons.</p>
  <p>Fall is a common turning point because moisture remains longer while growth slows. Missed adjustments during that period often compound existing issues, which explains the patterns seen in <a href="/watering-irrigation/why-fall-watering-is-often-missed.html">Why Fall Watering Is Often Missed</a>.</p>

  <h2>Soft ground starts changing the lawn’s shape</h2>
  <p>Wet soil compresses easily under traffic.</p>
  <p>Over time, this creates subtle low spots that collect even more water, locking the lawn into a worsening cycle that no schedule change can undo.</p>

  <h2>Stress appears even during moderate weather</h2>
  <p>When drainage is functioning, mild conditions give the lawn breathing room.</p>
  <p>If stress persists despite reasonable temperatures and rainfall, water is staying where roots cannot tolerate it.</p>

  <h2>Problem areas stop shrinking between events</h2>
  <p>Temporary drainage issues contract during dry stretches.</p>
  <p>When affected zones remain the same size or slowly expand, the soil has lost its ability to reset on its own.</p>

  <h2>The lawn reaches a decision point</h2>
  <p>At some point, the effort needed to correct drainage exceeds what the existing turf can handle.</p>
  <p>This is when the conditions described in <a href="/watering-irrigation/when-water-problems-are-permanent.html">When Water Problems Are Permanent</a> start to apply, not because care was ignored, but because structure has already been lost.</p>

  <h2>Drainage help becomes the only forward move</h2>
  <p>Once water consistently outlasts recovery, drainage is no longer optional.</p>
  <p>Without restoring movement below the surface, every other fix only delays decline instead of reversing it.</p>
