You are writing fully-finished GrizzlyGreens.net articles as complete HTML pages.

OUTPUT RULES (HARD):
- Output ONLY the final rewritten article HTML. No commentary. No planning. No explanations.
- No bullet points, no numbered lists, no arrows, no shorthand list formatting.
- Keep it in American English only.
- Use plain, direct, layman language. No “sciency” wording, no academic tone.
- Each article must read like a single forward-moving argument: every section escalates the same core idea with new consequences, not restated points.
- Do NOT repeat the same point in different wording across multiple sections.
- Do NOT add new sections or topics beyond the sample’s section structure style (H2 blocks + short paragraphs). Keep a similar section count/length feel to the sample unless the given topic naturally needs slightly more/less.
- Do NOT include advice steps, product recommendations, or how-to instructions unless the sample article does (assume it does not).
- Do NOT invent facts that require sources. Keep claims general, practical, and true-to-common-experience.

INPUT FORMAT YOU WILL RECEIVE:
A single CSV-style line like:
Title,filename.html,Link Text 1,/path1.html,Link Text 2,/path2.html,Link Text 3,/path3.html,Link Text 4,/path4.html
Sometimes there are only 2–3 links. Sometimes there are empty trailing commas. Handle it.

WHAT TO GENERATE EACH TIME:
- Build a full HTML page that matches the sample article’s structure exactly:
  - Same doctype, html/lang, head layout, and body layout.
  - Same header nav links.
  - Same footer links and copyright line.
  - Same stylesheet, favicon, apple-touch-icon, and /search.js include.
  - Same Google Analytics snippet (copy it exactly from the sample).
  - Same meta tag set (title, meta description, canonical, twitter tags, OG tags, article published/modified).
- Update only what must change:
  - <title> and <h1> must match the provided Title exactly.
  - canonical URL must be: https://grizzlygreens.net/{current-hub}/{filename}
    (Assume these articles belong under /soil-fertilizer/ unless the user explicitly provides a different canonical path.)
  - og:url must match the canonical exactly.
  - meta description must be 1–2 sentences, plain language, not fluffy, matching the article’s core claim.
  - twitter/og title + description must match.
  - article:published_time and article:modified_time must use the current date in America/Phoenix time, formatted like:
    YYYY-MM-DDT00:00:00-07:00
  - Keep og-default.png and its width/height/alt exactly like the sample.

INTERNAL LINK RULES (CRITICAL):
- You will be given 2–4 internal links (link text + href).
- Each link must appear exactly once in the article body as a normal <a href="...">Link Text</a>.
- Links must NOT be used as “bridges” or explanations.
  - The sentence must stand alone as a complete thought even if the link is removed.
  - The link should come AFTER the point is already fully made, as optional support.
  - Never write: “This is explained in [link]” or “See [link] to learn…”
  - Instead write a complete sentence, then append a short, natural support clause that could be removed without breaking meaning.
- Do not force links. If a link doesn’t fit a section, place it where it naturally supports a finished point.

STYLE TARGET:
- Same vibe as the sample: calm, confident, blunt, practical.
- Short paragraphs with momentum. No filler. No recaps.
- Each H2 introduces a new escalation: consequence → bigger consequence → bigger consequence.

WORKFLOW:
1) Read the Title + filename + links.
2) Draft an H2 structure similar to the sample’s pattern (around 10–12 H2 sections is fine unless the topic naturally needs fewer).
3) Write 1–2 paragraphs per H2, keeping it tight and escalating.
4) Insert the provided links naturally (each exactly once).
5) Output the final full HTML only.

    <h1>How to Prepare Grass for Summer</h1>

<h2>Summer stress is decided before summer begins</h2>
<p>Grass does not fail in summer because heat suddenly appears. Failure happens because roots, soil structure, and energy reserves were never built to handle prolonged demand.</p>
<p>Preparation is about reducing how hard summer pushes the plant and increasing how much strain it can absorb before systems break down.</p>

<h2>Root depth matters more than surface appearance</h2>
<p>Deep, functional roots allow grass to access moisture that remains stable even as surface soil dries. Shallow roots force dependence on frequent watering and leave no buffer when conditions turn hostile.</p>
<p>Anything that limits root growth in spring limits survival in summer.</p>

<h2>Soil stability sets the upper limit of tolerance</h2>
<p>Compacted or poorly structured soil restricts oxygen flow and water movement. During summer, those restrictions amplify heat stress by cutting off cooling and hydration at the same time.</p>
<p>Once soil becomes the bottleneck, no amount of surface care can compensate.</p>

<h2>Mowing decisions either protect or weaken grass</h2>
<p>Short mowing increases soil temperature, speeds evaporation, and removes stored energy. Taller grass shades the surface and slows moisture loss.</p>
<p>Summer preparation means avoiding cuts that reduce the plant’s ability to regulate heat and water.</p>

<h2>Uneven terrain changes how grass experiences heat</h2>
<p>Slopes shed water faster and dry unevenly, creating localized stress zones even when the rest of the lawn appears stable.</p>
<p>How grade alters moisture retention and root behavior is explained in <a href="/lawn-basics/how-slope-affects-grass-growth.html">How Slope Affects Grass Growth</a>.</p>

<h2>Clumping reveals underlying stress patterns</h2>
<p>Grass that grows in clumps is often responding to inconsistent moisture, compacted soil, or root restriction. These patterns become more pronounced under summer stress.</p>
<p>The mechanisms behind this behavior are detailed in <a href="/lawn-basics/why-grass-grows-in-clumps.html">Why Grass Grows in Clumps</a>.</p>

<h2>Watering strategy matters more than volume</h2>
<p>Frequent shallow watering trains roots to stay near the surface, increasing vulnerability. Infrequent deep watering encourages downward growth and builds drought resistance.</p>
<p>Preparation means teaching the lawn how to survive scarcity before scarcity arrives.</p>

<h2>Energy reserves determine recovery speed</h2>
<p>Grass enters summer with a fixed amount of stored carbohydrates. Those reserves are spent on cooling, respiration, and basic survival.</p>
<p>When reserves run out, decline accelerates even if watering continues.</p>

<h2>Some lawns cannot be prepared anymore</h2>
<p>Lawns with collapsed soil structure, dead crowns, or severe root loss cannot be conditioned for summer survival. At that point, stress exposure only confirms the failure.</p>
<p>How to identify when recovery is no longer realistic is covered in <a href="/lawn-basics/when-grass-is-beyond-saving.html">When Grass Is Beyond Saving</a>.</p>

<h2>Preparation is about reducing irreversible damage</h2>
<p>Summer will slow growth and change appearance regardless of preparation. The goal is not perfection but survival with the ability to recover.</p>
<p>Grass that enters summer strong rarely looks its best, but it avoids crossing the point of no return.</p>

  <h1>Difference Between Manual and Powered Tools</h1>

  <h2>The real difference is how fast the lawn’s buffer gets used up</h2>
  <p>Any contact with the lawn creates disruption that must be absorbed before growth can resume. That buffer is finite, and once it is spent, the system stalls.</p>
  <p>Manual tools rarely reach this point because their slower pace prevents the buffer from being consumed all at once.</p>

  <h2>Speed turns manageable impact into system-wide stress</h2>
  <p>Powered tools move fast enough to affect large areas before the lawn has processed the first disturbance. Instead of isolated strain, the entire yard enters the same stressed state at once.</p>
  <p>From there, each additional pass compounds what has not yet settled.</p>

  <h2>Fast work hides how often the same ground is hit</h2>
  <p>When coverage is quick, repeated contact feels harmless. In reality, each pass interrupts stabilization that was already underway.</p>
  <p>The lawn does not fail immediately. It quietly falls further behind.</p>

  <h2>Manual tools limit spread by limiting reach</h2>
  <p>Hand tools slow progress by design. That constraint keeps disturbance contained and allows unaffected areas to remain stable.</p>
  <p>The benefit is not gentleness, but reduced overlap.</p>

  <h2>Powered tools magnify small flaws</h2>
  <p>A dull edge, uneven setting, or vibration is repeated across the yard before it is noticed. What would be minor with slow work becomes widespread strain.</p>
  <p>This is why <a href="/tools-safety/how-tool-maintenance-extends-life.html">How Tool Maintenance Extends Life</a> also explains why lawns decline faster under powered equipment.</p>

  <h2>Distribution tools spread stress as efficiently as material</h2>
  <p>Spreaders do not self-correct. Any inconsistency is amplified by speed and distance.</p>
  <p>The result mirrors what is shown in <a href="/tools-safety/how-spreaders-actually-distribute-material.html">How Spreaders Actually Distribute Material</a>, where uneven delivery creates uneven strain.</p>

  <h2>Wear turns single actions into constant disruption</h2>
  <p>Tools rarely fail all at once. More often, they degrade in ways that subtly change contact with the ground.</p>
  <p>Those patterns align with <a href="/tools-safety/mistakes-that-shorten-tool-life.html">Mistakes That Shorten Tool Life</a>, where repeated minor errors prevent stabilization.</p>

  <h2>The non-recoverable boundary is repeated interruption</h2>
  <p>When disturbance resumes before the lawn finishes settling, progress stops entirely. The system no longer catches up between events.</p>
  <p>Past this point, even stopping briefly does not restore balance, because too much unfinished repair has stacked up.</p>

  <h2>Powered tools don’t cause failure, but they accelerate it</h2>
  <p>Because powered tools act quickly and broadly, they make it easier to cross the line where stabilization never completes.</p>
  <p>Once that line is crossed, effort no longer helps, and the difference between manual and powered tools becomes the reason the lawn fails despite constant work.</p>
